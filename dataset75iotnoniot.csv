" My favourite memory from fourth grade was a day that my class went to a nature reserve. The conservationists told me to grab some birdseed and hold it out in front of myself. All of a sudden, a bird landed in my hand and proceeded to eat some of my seeds. I was very surprised because at that point in my life I had never been so close to a bird before. Looking at them up close, they're very exotic and interesting animals, but as quickly as it came, it was gone. And I was hooked.. . Sadly every year, birds are ingesting the plastic that we humans deposit into their habitats. The birds regularly confuse these plastics for food and eat it. They also feed this plastic to their chicks. This project aims to help out the birds a little. Rather than allowing plastics to find themselves in landfills, we are going to make a recycled plastic bird feeder.. . My design is great for people without a lot of tools and/or skills. This is also a great home-school project for kids to do. Kids enjoy feeding the birds (which you can learn to do at the end). This is also a great way for them to learn some environmental stewardship.. Let's get started!. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. For this project you will need:. For this step, you will only need your smaller drill bit:. Drill four or five holes in parallel lines as shown in the picture in red. . Attach your larger bit to your drill and drill the two holes marked once again in red. Make sure that the holes are pretty much opposite to each other. These will be the holes for hanging your feeder. . Drill a hole at the end of both sticks. Drill a couple more holes along the center. While doing this be careful not to snap the popsicle stick in half. Try to only drill about five holes per stick.. You may be wondering why you have been drilling so many holes in odd places. Wonder no longer! These holes are for a technique that I call glue-filling. . The steps of how to glue-fill are as follows:. Glue-filling will help the glue permanently hold parts together. You will not be just utilizing the adhesion of the glue but the hardness of it as well. On my first feeder, I didn't glue-fill and after a couple of days, it broke.. Glue-fill all of the small holes in the lid. Try to join the fill for extra strength as shown in the picture. . Glue-fill the popsicle stick holes. . Put some fresh hot-glue over the glue-fill to glue the lid to the popsicle sticks. The sections of glue-fill should be touching. Try to move the popsicles sticks so they are parallel and centred on the lid.. This part is a little complicated so I broke it up into more manageable parts:. With your small drill bit again drill five holes it the bottom of your lid. These will let rainwater escape from the seed basin to prevent mold.. Even more glue-filling, I hope that you aren't bored of it yet. This will the last time, I promise. This time you will need to be careful of some things though:. Now for the moment you have all been waiting for! This part you only get one chance at so double-check everything before you move on. Look back at the picture a couple of times as this will help with the positioning.. Does everything look good? Great, follow these steps:. Put some glue on top of where filling it on the container. Now, align the fill in the cap to the container's fill and press down to glue them together.. To make the feeder hang better, tie an overhand loop in the center of the string. This also makes the feeder look nicer.. The whole purpose of this feeder was to hold food, right? I personally like to use black oil sunflower seeds, so my design (this one) works with those. You should be able to use any kind of seed, theoretically. Please let me know what kind you use in the comments. . I fill about 1/3 of the container before hanging it the first time, just in case it falls down for whatever reason. This will fill to almost the top with no problems, so really it is up to you how much to put in.. You will need to flip the feeder over right before you hang it, otherwise, it is probably better to leave it upside down.. When you do need to flip it follow these steps:. Before you hang your feeder, you should probably think about where it will go. Birds enjoy the security of being near a tree or tall bush to quickly hide from predators. Another thing to think about while hanging it is squirrels. Where I live they are a big problem. As an attempt to deter squirrels I  give my feeders a sphere of at least 2.5m(8ft) in diameter of clear space. this way squirrels can't leap onto my feeders from other branches or the ground. I also like to put my feeders in places that I will see from inside of my house. . To hang your feeder, you will need to:. Once you have birds coming to your feeder often, (which shouldn't take long depending on where you live) you will be able to hand-feed birds. This is an amazing thing to do with kids and is a very rewarding and fun activity. What are you waiting for?. I hope that you have enjoyed the process of creating your own recycled bird feeder. I also hope that this has brightened up your isolation period as much as it did mine. If you have any suggestions to improve my design, that would be awesome! . If you liked this project and want to show your appreciation, voting me in the trash to treasure contest would really help me out. Thanks!. Participated in the Trash to Treasure Contest. "
"How to upcycle  a coffee can into a chic birdhouse.  . Easy to make with hand tools and a few dollars in materials.. The most expensive part is probably the coffee that was originally in the can.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. These plans are adjustable to based on the coffee can you have.  I used a standard 10 oz foil can.. You need the energy and you need to empty the coffee can anyways.. I made my birdhouse out of rough cedar that I purchased at Menards.. Any big box store would have similar materials.. You will need the following:. This project is easily completed with hand tools.  Power tools make things faster but not always safer if you are doing this with a little helper.Tools needed:. Cut your boards to the sizes shown above.. You will need two pieces 4-1/4"" x 4-1/4"" square for the end panels.. Since our boards were 5-1/2"" wide, this will be the width of the widest roof panel.  . The other one will be cut to 4-3/4"" to give us a 1/2"" roof overhang.. The length of the roof panels is adjustable based on the size of your coffee can.. Measure your coffee can then add 1-1/2"" for each end or 3"" total to the length of the roof panels.. After cutting, you might want to hit all the edges with some sandpaper to avoid nasty splinters.. Measure in 1-1/2"" from each end of the roof panels to mark where the end panels will be.  . This will aid in assembly and nailing the birdhouse together later.. Use a rule and a square to mark your lines. . I know this is a birdhouse, but you can practice good layout skills even on a birdhouse. Use the narrow roof panel to layout where the glue and nails will go on the wider panel.. Pre-drill the nail holes with a 1/8"" twist drill.  This is not necessary, but this will keep wood from splitting.. In this photo, you can see where I marked the layout for the end panels.. Glue and nail the roof together.. I used three nails here.. Here you can see how things will go together.  . Notice the roof is now symmetrical and there is an even overhang on both sides.. This was designed as a wren house.. Draw an X from corner to corner and mark the center for the hole.. Use a 1-1/8"" spade bit to drill a through hole in one end panel.. If you want to make this for another type of bird, you will need to research what size hole you need.. Do not make the hole too large or you will get pests (eg. sparrows) living in you birdhouse.. Make sure your measurements and layout are still correct.. This is the last time to make adjustments.. Apply a bit of glue and assemble the end panels.. Use your layout lines to help you get these in the right place.. Pre-drill four nail holes (2 each side of roof) and assemble with 6d galvanized finish nails.. Take your time and check your alignment as you go.. Offset the nails slightly to avoid hitting another nail.. Use a few clamps or a helper if you need to while assembling the birdhouse.. Sometimes the parts like to move around too much while nailing.. Sometimes the nails will have a mind of their own.. This happens even when you are trying to be careful.. Take your time and tap or pull the nails out and try again.. I goofed on my layout lines.  I just moved the nail holes over a bit and re-nailed things together.. The birds will never know the difference.. Maybe you can offer to discount the rent.. Use a 1/4"" dowel rod to hold the coffee can and the wood together.. Layout and drill a hole for dowel. I placed mine about 1/2"" in from the corner.. I ended up using a 9/32"" drill bit.  The 1/4"" hole was too tight.. You will want the dowel to be secure, but you also need to able to remove it for cleaning and maintenance.. Drill a hole in both end panels.. Most people think a birdhouse needs a perch.. Have you ever seen a tree with a perch?. Birds will know how to get in and out of the birdhouse.. Sometimes the perch makes it too easy for predators to get to the eggs.. Trim it flush with the front of the house.. . I twisted two screw eyes about 1"" in from each end of the roof.. Pre-drilling will make this easier, but this is not necessary.. Use a pair of pliers or a nail to help screw these into the wood.. When the eyes are in, you are done!. Go outside and look for great places to hang your new birdhouse.. Congratulations on your project.. These are the screw eyes I used.. This pack cost me about $1.25 at Menards.. If you wanted to make this house last longer, I would use stainless steel hardware.. Here is another birdhouse I made using plastic canister from another brand of coffee.. Adjust the length of your roof panels to accommodate the difference in size of canisters..

" Build your own WiFi-Camera-enabled Bird Box, cheaply, and quickly. Perfect for an After-School/Club/Scouts project or a weekend DIY build. Watch birds build nests, raise young, and before long - the young fly leave the nest!. Although camera kits do exist for bird boxes, they have a few limitations - they are usually wired (i.e. not WiFi) and if they are, they are at least 2-3x more expensive than this - and don't 'scale up' effectively: You have to have one camera to one next box, it'll cost a fortune, if you wanted to observe multiple boxes. (With that said, if you do still want to install permanent 1:1 camera:box, then this is still much cheaper! (see Appendix 1)). . This 'bird cam variation' uses 3ml Syringe Tubes to create nifty little rainproof 'spy holes' to insert a WiFi endoscope in/out of, with minimal disruption to the nesting birds. The pictures and video can be viewed on any smartphone.. Endoscopes are used to inspect drains, under floors, doing car repairs - you name it. Consequently, they are made at higher volume than bird cams, and hence are cheaper (and arguably much more compact). Indeed, once the season is over / when not in use, you still have a useful device. So I think this is an effective way to get started, and if you really become obsessed, sure - upgrade to the fancy kit ;o). PS - Images are not from me. I'm just at the start of the season, and will update when I get pics.... Essentials:. Bird Box (x4 bargain): https://amzn.to/3cbFc30(Can get larger bulk quantities for Schools, but 4 seems a good starter pack!). WiFi Endoscope: https://amzn.to/2VgWupq(One endoscope can be taken round multiple boxes, where accessible).. Drill: https://amzn.to/2VfQAEJ (in case interested).. 3ml Syringes: https://amzn.to/3bXPkfH (suggested size).. 10mm Drill Bit: https://amzn.to/37WzKxj (suggested size).. Mini FIles: https://amzn.to/2VhyK4u . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. The Box shown is a fair price (around £3.5/box). It's hard to argue with this, when you consider you'd have to buy screws, hinges, paint, nails, and drill and assemble. So I really think that this is a good starter project - especially for schools, where many kids want to have a go, you can buy a large quantity to install in a number of locations.. However, if you really want to make one from scratch, this looks good:https://www.rspb.org.uk/fun-and-learning/for-famil.... I 'upgraded' this bird box with some dowel on the front, so birds could perch and check it out. I'm not sure how much this improves the chances of nesting, but it'd seem plausible to want to not fly into a hole without looking, right? We shall see.... I used a 3ml syringe, which has a 10mm OD and 8mm ID. . The camera has an OD of 7.75mm so fits nicely into the tube. It's coincidence, but works a treat.. Cut in two, around the '2.5ml' region - or - [10mm + the thickness of your bird box wood walls].. If you find it a bit tight, give it a stretch with some pliers. . I 'hovered' the camera in the approximate middle to check the alignment. This turned out to be 4.5mm from the back of the (roof) of the bird box, and naturally dead-centre. . Taking a 10mm drill bit, I drilled the hole. Note: first I drilled perpendicular to the roof, and then once 'established', I manoeuvred the drill to be vertical from the floor of the bird box. . Lastly, I gave the drill a slight 'wiggle' to allow a not too tight fit. . I inserted the Syringe piece from underneath, as shown.. I removed the 'collar' of the camera (this is a screw fitting for other attachments, not needed here), to give easy passage in the tube. If it is tight, use a small file, or a bit of studding to free up the hole.. Follow the instructions on the endoscope to get images, as above.. ---. Safe to say, rotating the camera to get a good angle is easy.. But do pay attention to the angle (x and y axis), and gently twist the syringe into the best position. . Don't glue it yet, but get happy with the set-up. . I realised if I made a 'viewing port', I'd need to create a reliable water-tight bung, that was still easy to remove. This might sound easy, but I can assure you from my time as an engineer at Dyson, that rubber seals are not trivial. So why 'reinvent the wheel' when there was a great one in the Syringe. Indeed, this was the initial inspiration, and as it fit the endoscope - it seemed to lucky to just ignore, so I wrote up the Instructable!! . Anyway, using a scalpel or pliers, cut the plunger in half, and re-insert the seal end into the syringe to stop water dripping on your chicks when not viewing with the camera.. So with my rubber ducky mounted on some blocks to what I anticipated to be the next height, I checked the camera function, focus, etc. I was very impressed, and as you can see the focal point is good. . Now you have the syringe 'camera mount' all set, carefully remove the camera.. Take some superglue and fix in place. If you have a lot of space that needs 'filling', use some woodglue, or even Sugru, as shown. Indeed, a pack of Sugru is rather expensive for one project, but I reckon one single pack of it would have done easily 10 seals here. . Adhesives:. Sugru (optional):  https://amzn.to/2T4MEEe . Wood Glue (optional):  https://amzn.to/2Vg2ajq .  Mini Super Glue (bargain!):  https://amzn.to/2Vg2ajq  (recommended to get). . Double Bubble Epoxy (not essential):  https://amzn.to/2Vg2ajq . I bit of an optional extra, but I like that this drilled-out twig looks nice, but is a secondary barrier to the elements.. Follow steps as shown, and be aware to cut slight angles, to match the slope of the roof, and also to keep rain off the top of the chimney/stick. . For c.£4 per box, one can get going with making quite a few of these!. My son and I were very pleased with these, and we'll look froward to installing these around the garden/trees/shed/etc. to see what works best.. Wish us luck!. OK - so forgive the earnestness here, but I'll be back with some real images in due course.. I'm not a fan of posting if I have not tested fully, but given this design is based on existing RSPB bird boxes, it really has no reason to perform less well than other successful alternatives. Safe to say one must take care not to disturb the birds once established, and if you're unsure, then perhaps installing the WiFi cam permanently might not be a bad idea. . Not only is the Endoscope WiFi Cam cheaper, but even if you use it 1:1 ratio, it will allow you to learn the best viewing angles for each species, etc. I will post more as I learn more =D. Although I've suggested keeping this setup as a high ratio of [experimental] bird boxes, and 1 camera, you can of course install the system 1 cam : 1 box, as a permanent setup. . To do this you'd need to place the WiFi transmitter in a waterproof enclosure. Sometimes called an 'IP rated' enclosure, these are commonly sold for all manner of electronics that need to survive the elements outdoors. . Luckily the endoscope cable (i.e. not unit) is waterproof, so this can be left exposed. However, the electronic 'box' and the USB connection should be placed inside. Care should be taken to ensure that the USB power supply wire is kept dry at the side being plugged in. . When working with main electricity (even when 'safe' at the USB side) care should be taken to ensure the installation is safe. If in doubt, consult an electrician or other qualified person. . For example: Enclosure: https://amzn.to/32n9viwUSB Charger: https://amzn.to/2PjDnar. You can buy a timer switch if you are the forgetful type! Timer: https://amzn.to/3a67H07. I realised I had some Syringe Tube left over. I was going to chuck this in the trash, when I realise that it might well be put to good use to create more viewing holes.... ...I set about installing them at different heights, vertically, but also horizontally too. . I've seen a few camera bird boxes, and it seems that one issue is that if the camera has poor low-light management, then the images are dim/poor quality. . Having just been playing around with vacuum forming in HDPE, from recycled Milk Jugs, I realised I could make a nice 'opaque' window from this. I used a heat gun for quickness, as the form was simple. Steps as shown. . I should say upfront, I'm very sceptical about the various advertised bird boxes that claim to be able to stick with suction-cups to windows, and be able to be viewed from inside. . Firstly, I think the suction cups will not cope with changes in moisture, heat, cold, etc. - and will likely fall off, which would be a real shame if there were eggs/young killed in the process. . Secondly, I suspect that if mounted to a 'busy' window, this will freak out the birds. I didn't see any convincing reviews or videos of people with actual birds nesting. My hunch is that it needs to be covered up most of the time - hence I chose a window I have in my shed, which the blind is usually down. Do hopefully this will work. We shall see..... If you have any tips, pictures - please post below.. If you have a school or are a teacher, do ask if anything is unclear - I intend to do this at my local nursery/afterschool facility, so hence trying to keep costs down..

                . Love the concept. Thanks for sharing. Would like to do something similar with a couple of the bird houses we've scattered about - BUT, I do not have a Cell Phone!  I have Internet and a router and Wi-Fi, Chromecast and (Win7 / Win10 laptop(s) and would like to find a WIRELESS Borescope thing that I could connect to as I do my HP Wireless printer.So, Is there such a thing? Or ""an app for that?""One other question on the chance that you've done more research than I accomplished last night: Is your device one that uses a fiber optic cable?Anyone?.

                . Hi. Thanks for the kind words. Glad you like it =)Sadly, I personally didn't find 'an App for that', as even most Emulators don't likely work with something like this (or unless you're a coder are tricky). X-Code et al. I think you're asking for a WPS function on this scope, but it seems unlikely as this is a next level of 'smarts', but I could be wrong, but nothing in the description that suggests otherwise.~ If I were in your shoes, assuming you're game for $40 to make this, you can honestly pick up an unlocked second hard Android phone for probably $50 on Amazon or eBay. the DEPSTECH software needs nothing fancy to fun it. So I'd consider that perhaps? You don't even need a SIM card. Hope that's helpful..

                . Love what you've done -- but had an idea on how it could be taken a bit further.  You wouldn't need to send in a camera probe to get results or ever disturb the birds.But how about a very inexpensive micro-board with camera and a solar panel on the roof? It could wake up every so often take a photo.  And then once a day it could upload all the photos over wifi.Micro: ESP32-camSolar arrays to support battery typebattery under protective housing.

                . Hi Capt!Thanks for the message. I'll fess-up and say I'm no coder (no shock, huh!), so this project was part borne out of my lack of ability, but also an awareness that there are many people who'd want to use cameras but also are not 'techy'. It's pretty much plug-n-play! That said, it is certainly on my radar to do a PIR sensor update (but it'll be more expensive but essential for situations like monitoring Hedgehogs, etc. - which need a 'trigger'), so I'll put it to be folks I'm working with to look at the ESP32. So, thanks for that =)J.

                . I put mine on the side, and I'm hoping it's enough, but I worried that it'd leak on the top, as it's harder to do a seal that way. But I'm open to suggestions. And indeed, if birds dislike skylights, and prefer sidelights. Complex animals, huh! xD.

                . I love this project since I've built a few birdhouses in my days as a Boy Scout & now. I have one suggestion/tip. Make the back panel longer than the house itself. The extra wood extending beyond the bottom of the house makes for easier and more secure mounting. A house hanging from a nail will eventually fall. You can also have the panel extend above as well, but you have to modify your hinged roof. Another option is a hinged front that swings out from the top. .

                . I think I got lucky with this particular birdbox - as cheap as it is, it has a brass 'keyhole', and I mounted it on a 2inch screw, so I'm hoping that'd do it. But taking your point seriously, I do think a backboard is a good suggestion, and given the storms of late, I'm inclined to reinforce actually, before anything sets up nest. Nice idea with the 'side flip' roof...will have a think at how to do this for V2.0! Thanks..

                . This is a fantastic concept and project! The next step would be to modify it with a motion sensor that could detect when a bird enters or exits the box and give it a stand-alone power source. I'm thinking of an application where a the scope stays attached to a single box and off in a tree and one might walk within wifi range and simply use the phone's app to see what's going on. This is beyond my talents but it's cool to think about..

                . That's a great call :o) I guess I've been aware that I could do some fancy Raspberry Pi stuff, but of course it requires some knowledge of coding. This project is certainly more 'low entry' on skill level, intentionally. That said, I'd be up for finding a simpler hack....so here's hoping Instructables community might have some ideas! There is a very comprehensive one I mentioned, but it's very very advanced tbh. So something in-between is needed. Hmmm. Any thoughts - please share!.

                . The biggest advantage would be infrared LED which the birds can not see. I am thinking about doing this for owl boxes so 24/7 daylight might be an issue. Be sure to get the ones that will allow the the IR LEDS to stay on with exterior power. The other issue is supplying power. While power cables are cheaper than video cable ( not much) since you need to supply power ( for constant use) might as well use a wired camera. This is a great project, I am just tweaking it to my personal need. Here is an IR borescope but not wifi https://www.overstock.com/Electronics/SpyTec-16ft-USB-Borescope-Endoscope-Inspection-Camera-w-IR-LEDs-for-Night-Vision/14585391/product.html.

                . So I've not tested this, but it seems around £28 (inc postage in UK). https://amzn.to/2I2ieNS True, tiny 10-buck spy cams do exist, but often get warm quickly - I was keen to put as much of the electronics away from the birds as possible. I might be worrying unnecessarily, but until I know better <<please comment if you do>> I'm trying to minimise disturbance to birds. Thanks for comment tho - got me thinking! .

                . Thanks... I'm going to try this. Although I'm no birdhouse expert, I have read in more places than one that the perch on the outside is totally unnecessary and even a hazard as it gives predators like raccoons, squirrels, etc. a perch to hang on to while burglarizing the nest. I've made a point to watch the birds around here and none of them seem to have a problem perching on the entry hole while investigating their future home. .

                . Some species of birds require the perch, for others they do not want the perch.You can use that to select the kind of bird that you want in the bird house.You will have to do some research to find out their preference.. © 2020 Autodesk, Inc.. "
" Building a birdhouse can be a difficult, yet rewarding task. There are many different types of birds, which is why there are so many different types of birdhouses that you can make. As by reading the title, the birdhouse that we will be giving you instructions on how to make is a bluebird birdhouse. It can be difficult, but as you work on it, it gets easier, because you will be repeating many steps and using the same measurements. Since it is hard to explain how to build something with only words and no pictures, or no words and only pictures, I have created this instructable to help you build your birdhouse.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Before you start the project, you are going to want to gather the following materials and tools:. -Materials Needed:. -Tools Needed:. -Extra Notes:. . After you have gathered all of the materials and tools you need, it is time to begin the actual constructional process. First thing you need to do is measure 10 3/8"" from the start of the 4' board. Line it up carefully at the saw, and cut on the line. Set the piece you just cut out aside, and make another measurement at 10 3/8"" on the long board and cut it out.  You should now have 2, 10 3/8"" pieces out of the 4' board. The two pieces will be for your left and right sides of the birdhouse. The only special thing that needs to be done with the sides is that you need to cut the top at an angle. I will include pictures, but basically what we did is we had the wood vertically in front of us, so we could see the flat side, and measured 10 degrees down from the top on the left side for the right wall, and the right side for the left wall. This way, the smooth side can be out on each side. After marking the 10 degree space, cut from the opposite corner down to the 10 degree mark. Make sure that when you cut it, you don't trim any of the top, because you do not want to change the length. I have included pictures to help you understand.. To cut out the piece that will be the front of the birdhouse, you want to start by measuring 9 1/2"", then cut that piece out. The front will have features that are for this birdhouse. First, take the piece you have just cut out, and measure 7 1/4"" up from the bottom. Make a mark on that spot, then find the halfway point across, so it intersects with the mark you made from the bottom. now, take your 1 1/2"" hole saw, and center it where the two marks meet, and drill the center hole. This is where the birds will enter. After you drilled the hole all the way through, measure 1/2"", and use your square to make a line all the way to each end. Then measure another 1/4"" down from that one, and another from that line. You should now have three lines, each spaced 1/4"" from each other and the 1/2"" down from the hole. We used the sliding square to help keep the saw straight. You made the lines so the birds could grip to the house, and this is better than putting a peg in, because predators can grab onto the peg and reach into the house. Next, you are going to want to change your saw angle to 10 degrees, and bevel the edge from the top. You want to make it so it is slanted down towards you. Make sure that when you bevel the edge, that you don't cut any of the length down. You are going to want your smooth side up, so when you bevel the edge, it is the right way when assembly time comes.. The bottom has many unique features that will all be covered in this section. First order of business, you want to measure 4"" from the 4' board. Then, you want to measure 1/4"" away from each side of every corner. Then, you can draw a line from each mark on the corners, or you can just cut across. Sand the edges to make each corner rounded. Doing this creates little spaces where air can flow through, and any water that gathers in the house can drain out.. After cutting out all of your sides of the birdhouse, you should have a piece of wood that is approximately 1' 1 3/8"", or 13 3/8"". The only thing that you need to do with the back piece is bevel the top part, just like you did to the front. When you bevel the back piece, you will need the rough part of the wood facing up, unlike the front piece, where it was facing up. If you don't have a rough and a smooth side, you just need to make sure that you have your beveled edges going the right way. You want the wood to be slanted the same way, towards you. After you having finished beveling the back part, it's time to measure and cut the roof.. Now that you have used up your 4' board, you will need your second piece of wood. It needs to be 1 x 8, so 1extra inch are allowed on both the left and right sides of the house. The board should be 10 1/2"" long, and 9 1/4"" wide, so the board shouldn't need to be cut. Before you move on to the step, check and make sure that the roof ends are squared. The main part for the roof is when you are going to attach it to the rest of the birdhouse.. After you have fully cut your pieces, it is time to assemble your birdhouse. There is a certain way that we attached the sides, which made it a lot less difficult to put together. First, we started by attaching the right side to the back piece. The measurement we used most is 3/8"", which is half the thickness of the board. When you first place the right side on the back, you want to mark 1/8"" down from where you beveled the edge. It should be 1/8"" down from the bottom of the bevel. We put the right side on that mark, and clamped it to the back. We measured down 2"" from the top where the right side meets the back, and 3/8"" in from the left side of the back. Then we measured 2"" up from where the right side meets the back on the bottom, and 3/8"" in from the left side. Make sure that your measurements are all on the back side of the birdhouse. Pre-drill the hole, so the wood doesn't split, and then drill the screw in. Do that to each meeting point. That is how to attach the right side.. After you successfully attached the right side to the back piece, it's time to attach the bottom. First, you want to look at you right side piece, and make a mark 1/8"" up from the bottom. You are going to put the bottom edge of the bottom piece on that line. We clamped the bottom to the right/back piece. Clamps are optional, but they aid in assembly. After clamping the bottom to the assembled piece, we looked at the right side, and measured 1-1/4"" from the left side of the right piece, and the right side where it meets the back, not starting on the back side. Then, since we pushed the back up 1/8"", you want to measure 1/2"" up from the two points you just made. Now just like before, you pre-drill the hole, then put the screw in. Now that you have the 3 pieces attached, it's time to attach the front.. Lay the front piece on your assembled piece so it is flush (even) with the bottom of the right side, and so it lays flush on top of the right side. First, you want to mark 1"" up on the face from the right side, and 3/8"" from the edge. Now, measure 1"" down from where the beveled section ends, and 3/8"" in, so it's in line with the bottom screw. Pre-drill and then drill in the screw. Now, find the middle of the front piece, and mark it on the bottom. From that point, measure 1/2"" up, so the screw goes into the middle of the back. Pre-drill and drill in the screw. Now that you have fully attached the front, it is now time to put the left side on. . This side will be the most difficult, because it will be a swinging door, which allows you to open up the bird house and clean it out. First, you can make a reference line using your square and a pencil, make a line from the middle of your screw to the other side. Doing this makes it easier to make the screws aligned. Make a mark 3/8"" in from the left side on the front face, where your reference line is. You can now pre-drill and drill in the screw. When you pre-drill, make it just a little bit deeper, so your side can swing and the screw can be tight. If you want to make it easier, make a reference line going down across the left side, then 3/8"" onto the back. The screw for the left sides that are on the front and the back must be in line with each other, otherwise the left side won't swing. These screws act as the hinge.Pre-drill, and drill in the screw. Test and make sure that the left side swings. Now, to keep it from swinging open, make a reference line just like before, but on the bottom. Make a mark 3/8"" in from the reference line you just made, and pre-drill a little deeper, just like the other left side screws. This screw keeps it in place. If you want to open the left side, take out the bottom screw on the left, so you can open it. Now, we move on to attaching the final piece, the roof.. Since you beveled the edges, the roof will be attached at a slant. First, with the birdhouse laying front side up, lay the roof down, so it's flush with the beveled edges and sits on the table. This is the easiest way to attach the roof. Now, you want to center the roof, so there is an equal amount of overhang on the left and right sides (it is good to make marks with a pencil after it is centered, so you don't lose the correct placement). If you want, you can clamp it down so you don't lose your placement. We marked 1 3/4"" from each of the edges on the top, then 3/8"" from the back edge. Both of these will be along the back edge. After your measurements are correct, pre-drill and drill in the screw. Now, you only need to do two more screws. Now, you want to measure approximately 6 5/8"" from the back edge, so if you were to draw a line down, it goes through the first screw on the top. After you have your mark 6-5/8"" down and 1 3/4"" in from both sides, you can pre-drill and drill in the screws for the final time. Now you're almost done! Just a few things for clean up and finishing touches, and you'll be good to go!. Now, you can take your Orbital Sander, and sand each flat face. After all of the pencil marks are gone, you can take your sheet sandpaper, and run it along the edges, which makes them smooth. Be careful not to get any slivers! And now you are done! You can mount it on a tree or a fence post, close to a source of water. You can drill it into a tree from the access wood on the bottom, and angle a screw in from the top to secure it that way.

" Our local woodworking club has an annual Birdhouse Contest.  It's an opportunity for us to try to out-do each other, so we get some crazy entries.  I made this Rubik's Cube Birdhouse.  I always try to make something that would be funny to see birds using.  But, I spend so much time building and decorating them that I just put them on display in my workshop, rather than let the animals and weather destroy them.  This one is no different.. Watch my build video, then follow the instructions and pictures in this Instructable to build one yourself!. Supplies:  6-foot 1x10 pine board, wood glue, spraypaint, one 1-1/4"" screw, blue tape, sticker label (optional). Tools:  Table Saw, Drill, Drill Bits, Sander, Screwdriver, Clamps, Printer (optional). Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. My birdhouse was made from six 9"" squares with 45-degree bevels on each side.  You could certainly build the box using straight cuts and butt joints if you want by adjusting the dimensions of the sides to get a cube.. I tilted the table saw to 45-degrees, then set the fence so that it was 9"" away from the point where the blade exits the board.  I cut all four sides to make a square and repeated that 5 more times.  I recommend the magnetic Wixey Digital Angle Gauge for getting accurate bevel cuts.  First, you zero it on the flat saw table, then stick it on the blade to set the right angle.. I selected one piece for the front of the birdhouse and drilled a 1.5"" hole, which is suitable for bluebirds.  We have a lot of those here in the ATL.. Tip!  Birds are picky about the size of their birdhouses and holes.  Find out what kind of birds are in your area, then look up a birdhouse dimensions chart to find a suitable size house for your birds.  Also, birds don't need a perch so ditch the dowel - it will just embarrass them.. I glued the front piece and 3 other pieces together using blue tape for clamping pressure.  I made sure the edges were flush and the box was square.  After gluing on the top, I added a cross brace across the bottom opening so I would be able to screw on the bottom.  I used my trim router to put an 1/8"" roundover on the corners.. Tip!  When making a birdhouse, it's a good idea to have a way to open it so you can clean it out.. To make it look like a Rubik's Cube, I set the height of the table saw blade to about 1/4"" and cut some shallow grooves 1/3 of the width into the box.  My box was 9"", so I set the fence about 3"" away from the blade.. That little yellow Gator Zip Sander is awesome!. It is a good idea to add drainage holes in the bottom of a birdhouse.  I drilled a few holes inside the grooves on the bottom piece.  I also drilled a countersunk hole in the center of the bottom so I could screw it onto the box.. I used yellow, red, blue, green, white, and orange spray paint to paint the sides of the cube.  Tape on some paper towels to block over spray from getting on previously painted sides.. Note:  One of my YouTube viewers commented that birds stay away from bright colors, like red or orange.  Not sure if that's true or if it was just a troll, but you can't build a Rubik's Cube Birdhouse without them!  Just be aware that if you want to put yours outside for the birds, do a little research on this ""tip"" and maybe you should paint the front a different color.. I masked off the grooves and painted them black so it would look more like a Rubik's cube.  I recommend using a heaver paper than paper towels to block the paint, because the paint did soak through and bleed a little.  It was easily scraped off with a razor blade though.. I used regular copy paper to mask off the corners and painted them black as well.  The copy paper did a much better job at blocking the paint than the paper towels.  Peeling off the masking to reveal the finished paint job was so satisfying!. I printed the original Rubik's Cube logo on a sticker label and stuck it on the center white square.  Since I'm going to just display this birdhouse, I made a little triangle stand for it.. If I was going to actually put this outside for the birds, I would probably attach it to a tree or fence.  I felt bad that the birds wouldn't get to use it, so I made some less time-consuming birdhouses for them out of cedar fence boards.. Thanks for checking out my Instructable!

" When the Polar Vortex decided to turn New England into a deep freezer, the birds that I regularly feed always looked cold. They would fluff their feathers as much as they could and hunker down as low as possible to minimize the wind effects. The final straw was a Carolina Wren hiding under a board on my daughter's deck. That tiny bird was doing its best to stay warm and ALIVE, and I felt compelled to do something to help. I know there are a variety of roosting pockets and houses available for sale, but I love to crochet and I knew I could make something similar. That is how this project was born.. Note: You’ll need to know basic crochet techniques and stitches to complete this Instructable.. Materials Needed:. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Rnd 1: Magic circle (or whatever your preferred starting ring might be), ch-1, 10 HDC in center of ring; sl st to top of 1st HDC. (10 sts).

Weave in the start tail before you go any further.. Now for the sides.. Rnd 6: ch-1, BLO 1 HDC in ea st around (50 sts) (By using only the back loops, the stitches are forced to stand perpendicular to the bottom.). When I do Back Loops Only, I make sure to pick up two parts of the stitch to ensure a good hold that won’t stretch like a single part will. In the first picture, you can see all the parts on the hook.. The close up view shows you how I find the extra part for this version of BLO.. The third picture shows what it will look like turned upside-down when the round is complete.. Rnd 7 & 8: Using both loops (here and for rest of pattern), 1 HDC in ea st around (50 sts).

Rnd 12: HDC in same st as ch-1, HDC in 44 sts; 2 HDC in last st; ch 6; sl st to join beginning of rnd.. Rnd 13: ch-1, DO NOT TURN; HDC in same st as ch-1, HDC in 45 sts; 4 SC into ch-6 space; sl st to join beginning of rnd. (By using Single Crochet stitches and a chain-6, it causes the opening to arch.). Rnd 14-17: ch-1, HDC in same st as ch-1, HDC in 49 sts, sl st to join, ch-1 (50 sts). Time to put a rounded roof on the shelter (the most complicated part).

Rnd 20: (starts with 32 sts) HDC in same st as ch-1, HDC2tog (decrease), HDC in next st; *HDC in next st, HDC2tog (decrease), HDC in next st; repeat from * around; sl st to first HDC, ch-1 (8 decreases = 24 sts). Rnd 21: (starts with 24 sts) HDC in same st as ch-1, HDC2tog (decrease); *HDC in next st, HDC2tog (decrease); repeat from * around; sl st to first HDC, ch-1 (8 decreases = 16 sts). Rnd 22: (starts with 16 sts) HDC2tog (decrease) same st as ch-1 and next st; *HDC2tog (decrease); repeat from * around; sl st to first HDC (8 decreases = 8 sts).. Fasten off, leaving enough tail (around 25”) to close top and make a hanging loop. Weave tail through all 8 sts and pull tight. Tie off, then chain approximately 20 links for the loop. Tie off the chain and weave remaining tail very securely through sts.. The completed Roosting Pocket: the first picture is the view from the front and the second picture is of the bottom. I stuffed it to show the shape.. Cut 9 bamboo skewers in half, and use the unpointed pieces for perches. Put three pieces together, then use thread or thin twine and lash them at each end to make a single perch. Repeat the procedure two more times, resulting in 3 perches. . One perch should be inserted side to side, one or two rows above the bottom of the pocket, and centered between the front and back. The second and third perches should be inserted front to back, one to the right and just above the port, and the other to the left of the port and slightly higher. This will give the birds a variety of seating options.. Insert a perch in between stitches at the desired location. Find the corresponding space on the opposite side and bring the end out at the same level.. The pictures show the front view and back view of perch placement:. Once you’ve inserted the perches, hang the Roosting Pocket in a sheltered south- or east-facing location, somewhere where birds would naturally seek protection from harsh weather. Be sure to make daytime checks inside the pocket as winter progresses into spring and the days start to get longer.  If you see signs of a nest in progress (addition of twigs, grass, moss, or lots of feathers), take it down immediately -- roosting pockets are NOT a safe place for babies!  Even if you don't see nesting activity, it's best to take the pocket down after the danger of frost has passed.. Remove the perches before laundering.  They could probably stand a seasonal weak-bleach treatment and then thorough air-dry before  being bagged for storage.. According to the Lion Brand label, the yarn I used can be machine washed separately with mild soap on gentle cycle. Use lukewarm water. Do not bleach. It does not require fabric softener and its use is not recommended. Tumble dry on low heat and remove promptly. Hand washing and drying is also an option, using warm water and mild detergent. Rinse well in cold water, then squeeze and roll in a towel to remove excess moisture. Spread item flat on a smooth surface and allow to dry thoroughly. Do not hang to dry..

" Installing a Bird Feeder can allow you to help some species during the middle of winter when food is scarce. You will also be able to observe some of the species that live near your garden, take pictures of them or just enjoy the presence of the bird.. This Instructable explains how to cut and build your own bird feeder with a laser cutter.. Enjoy !. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. The given file is optimized for use with an Acrylic plate or any other material that can be laser cut.. I used 250mm*500mm plates that are 3mm thick. If you want to use another dimensions, you can rearrange the design be be careful to drill adapted slots to mount easily the bird feeder !. You can also get 4 M3 screws to add an holder that will help you to attach the feeder to a tree, or use clamps or glue.. Download the attached file and cut it, you can also add some custom engraving if you want ^^. With a hot air gun, or any other source of heat, you can heat and fold the two bars with holes that will be useful to attach the feeder to a tree. There are tiny holes to help you to fold at the right place. When heating it, the plastic will soften, then you will be able to do a 45° angle with it and maintain it while it cool down.. Be very careful when using hot tools !. Assemble all the pieces together, and use the 14 small ""keys"" to hold all pieces together. Normally all pieces and slots are different so you can't make a mistake building it !. Same thing that the precedent step, you can heat and fold the corners of the roof. Be careful not to heat it too much or the plastic might burn or get ugly bubbles ! Be patient and fold it when the plate is softened over the whole width. I used M3 screws and bolts, but you could maybe use some glue or even clamps to make it 100% plastic ;-). I used some sunflowers seeds to fill it, in France (where I live) some bird like Great tits like them a lot !. Now you only have to find a tree to install it, thanks to it's holders that can help you to maintain it with wire in the holes..

" Spring is coming up and I'm planing on adding new birdhouses to our garden. I've found and old PVC sewer pipe in my workshop which would be just perfect for this project. I've seen something similar in a garden center, but I'd rather build it on my own and I can recycle the old PVC pipe as well. I'm planing to build two different kind of houses. There will be two similar ones, which are shaped like a mail box for newspaper (horizontal pipe) and one which looks like common birdhouse (vertical pipe with a small roof).. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. I need three pieces from my pipe to build the bodies of the houses. The two horizontal houses have a length of each 35cm (30cm due to the angular cut) and the vertical house a height of 25cm (20cm due to the angular cut). The pipe has a inner diameter of ~10cm. Please see the picture for all dimensions.. I use two parallel wooden strips as a jig, which helps me cutting. I use a saw to cut the pipe. I can use one angular cut for two bodies.. I use a piece of plywood for the back and front. I need two circular pieces and one ring-shaped piece for one birdhouse (two for the vertical house). The diameter equals the inner diameter of the pipe. I use a compass to draw three equal circles, one with a smaller inner circle (the ring should have a thickness of 1-2cm). . I drill a hole into the inner circle and use it to cut it out with a jigsaw. Now I cut out the outer circles.. I repeat this process once for the second birdhouse. The vertical house needs just one circular and one ring-shaped piece.. The front needs an entrance hole and a perch. The diameter of the entrance is very important and defines the type of bird which might be using the house. I've found a nice list of typical diameters for some species: https://www.thespruce.com/bird-house-hole-sizes-386641. You might need a bigger pipe for the big birds :D. I use a foster drill to cut the entrance hole and a normal wood drill for the perch. The perch is a simple round-shaped wooden beam. I use wood glue to mount it to the front panel. I add a stainless hook to the back panel, which makes it easier to remove it later on for cleaning purposes.. The vertical house needs a roof. Therefore I cut a square out of the plywood using my jigsaw. You can use a straight lath as a guidance. I use a edge length of 18cm.. To mount the roof to the pipe I use a router to mill a a small groove into the roof part. Therefore I mark the pipe using a pencil. I fixate the part with my clamp and use my router freehanded to mill the groove. The groove is not perfect, but it's enough for this project. The groove will be later filled with glue and silicone so nobody will notice it :D.. I want to cover the roof with a sheet of metal. I had some spare from building a carport. I cut a square out of the sheet, which is 2cm wider on each site than the roof (22cm). There might be condensed water between the wooden sheet and the metal sheet. Therefore I use a small piece of roofing paper to protect the wood from moulding. I just nail it to the plywood using galvanized nails.. I wrap the metal sheet around the wood, fold it at the edges and use the same nails to fixate it.. The vertical house has no front made of wood. The body itself has the entrance and the perch. Therefore I use a foster drill to cut the entrance and a wood drill to cut two holes for the perch (one on each site). The perch goes direct through the whole body.. I will cover the bodies with spry paint. Therefore I use grinding paper to roughen the surfaces and water to clean it up afterwards.. Let's get some color, shall we? I hang the bodies on a rope and start painting the inner surfaces and edges. While the parts are drying, I build a small rack, which will help me during the painting process. . The parts are dry and I mount them to my rack. I can rotate the parts just by rotating the rack. During the rotation I can apply the paint evenly.. The wooden parts need a coating as well. I use three layers of white paint, which is suitable for the outdoors. The perch is going to be red as a nice eye-catcher :).. Now I can mount the front and the ring-shaped parts to the bodies. I use three stainless screws and three plastic washer for each part. The plastic washer will seal the hole and will keep the water outside. I mark three spots equally around the pipe and drill small holes with a thin drill. I fasten the screws using a screwdriver. Be careful and do not apply to much force.. The perch for the vertical house goes right through the body. I use a small screw on the back to fixate it.. I glue the roof to the body using waterproofed glue. Well that's it almost :). My jigsaw, ok, well I did a poor job with cutting out the round shaped parts. To fix that and to make the house waterproof I add a small amount of silicone to the gap between the wood and the ""house wall"". I'll do that with all front and back panels and the roof.. The birdhouses will hopefully house some birdies over the spring and summer. To clean them in fall, I add a simple hatch to the back. It's just a lid fixated with screws. The lid covers the ring-shaped part.. Congratulations, everything is done and you are hopefully a proud owner of some new birdhouses. Let's take them outside for a foto shooting in the wilderness :D . I use two different methods of mounting the houses. Method one is just a nylon rope within a tree. Method two are pipe clamps mounted to a shed or carport. It's important to face the entrance to the right direction. As far as I know, the birdies like their doors pointed to east/east-south direction (opposing the weather face).. I hope you will enjoy building this. Please let me know your experiences and improvements. Please put photos in the comments. :). Participated in the Trash to Treasure. "
" So I saw a bird house made like this so I gave it a shot.  I liked the natural look with a little man made ( dare  I say Steam Punk? ) look. It wasn’t that hard and I made it with stuff I had sitting around my garage. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. A hunk of tree. I used a piece of wood that was basically unsplit firewood.Chain saw or ban saw.Forstner bitDrillHammerWood chiselsWood screws Tin or aluminum ( or some other roof material option )Pallet wood or some other flat piece of woodDrill bits . Find the right piece of wood.  It’s diameter needs to be enough so you can rip it, sawing off the back 1/3.  I cut the piece of wood down to a manageable size before ripping the back of it.  I used a chain saw to rip the back but depending on the size, a ban saw might work. . Now, you need to start “gutting” a nesting place out of the large piece.  You’re cleaning the wood out from the back of the house.  Before you clean it out, think about where your entrance will be coming in from the front and the size of the bird your trying to attract.  There are plenty of web sites out there that will tell you what size bird house entrance will attract what species of bird.   I used a Forstner bit to clean out the house. . I cut most of the house  out and then drillled in from the front to make sure the living space was lined up with the entrance.  The forstner bit is perfect for that. . So I cleaned  it out. I made sure the entrance was not too long.  Now, I took a piece of aluminum pipe used for exhaust vents and cut a piece to cover the “roof”.  I wanted to give it a little different look but was also hoping it would keep rain off the top of the house. Attach the roofing material ( my roof didn’t look spectacular but again, it was the first one I made).Now, how are you going to close up the back of the house?  You can use the original piece you cut earlier.  I used a piece of pallet wood and attached it with the wood screws.  You may want to drill some starter holes to prevent splitting.  . I forgot to take picture of a couple of the final steps. Sorry about that.  But here’s the final product.  I used the pallet wood on the back for a different look and  so it would be easier to hang  the bird house on my fence.    I’ll make a few more birdhouses soon and try to perfect the process.  I may try cleaning out the birds living quarters with my chain saw instead of the forstner bit to see if it speeds up the build.  But in the meantime, happy building! . "
" We recently moved into a new house which has huge picture windows.  One of the side windows looks out onto a narrow side yard.  We placed our cat's large tree in front of that window and then hung a couple bird feeders on hooks on the fence outside so he would have some ""cat tv"" for entertainment.  This was okay, but the feeders hung too low, the big hooks were expensive, and the seed got wet since we live in the wonderful Pacific Northwest.  So we needed a better solution.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. I made a hasty sketch and roughed out my ideas. My priorities for the structure were:. 1) it could hold multiple bird feeders. 2) it would provide a shelter so the seed would not get wet. 3)  the structure would be flexible so that feeders can change throughout the seasons. 4)  the size would be large enough to ""fill"" the 7ft picture window width. 5) it would be tall enough so the view was maximized for people sitting in the front room looking out that picture window (and for the cat!). 6) it would help obscure the view of the neighbor's house and back yard.. Then I called my dad and talked about what was needed to turn the sketch into a viable design - proper roofing, increase footings, etc. (Thanks Dad!).. Here are the items we used for our build:. (Quantity - Material). 2 - 4x4x10 treated wood posts. 1 - cardboard concrete tube (cut in half), we used an 8"" wide tube. 2 - 80 lb bags of Quikcrete. 7or 8 - treated or untreated 2x4x8 lumber (they are not in contact with the ground, so we used untreated). 1 - treated 2x6x8 lumber. 2 - untreated 1x4x8 lumber (you will have quite a bit left over). 1 - 4x8x3/4 exterior grade plywood (cut in half lengthwise by the DIY store). 1 - 8 ft length of 3/4 metal electrical conduit pipe. 2 - 5 ft lengths of 5"" ducting pipe. 1 - package of 3-tab asphalt shingles (I got a damaged package from Home Depot for $10). 1 - roll of asphalt paper (you will have LOTS left over after this project). 1 box - 3/4 inch roofing nails. 1 box- 2 1/2 inch exterior screws. 1/2 box - 3 inch exterior screws. 1/2 box - 1 1/2 inch exterior screws. 4 - EMT straps (U-shaped ones with a hole at each end). 6 - Slant Nail Joist Hangers. 2 - 1-9/16-in x 3-9/16-in Rafter Ties (this holds a 2x4 on top of the 4x4 post). 2 - L-brackets. staples. These items were a mixture of purchased items and ones we had on hand, so I am sure improvements/changes could be made in the materials list.  NOTE:  I got most of my metal fittings from Habitat for Humanity's Restore at a great price since they sell them by the pound.. The tools we used:  circular saw, hand saw, drill, speed square, staple gun, post-hole digger, hammer, 2-way post level, level, angle grinder.. The window is 7 foot wide, so we positioned the posts to line up with the ends of the window. We dug 2 holes  approximately 25 inches deep and about 10 inches wide with a post-hole digger.  Then we threw all the stones we hit while digging the holes into the bottom.  Next, we cut the cardboard concrete tube in half using a hand saw, and placed one half in each of the holes, on top of the stones.. We placed one 4x4 post in each of the holes, inside the tubes, and braced them using various materials we had on hand.  Then we mixed up the two bags of Quickrete and put one in each hole around the posts.  We used a stick to tamp down the concrete around the posts, then left them to set (sorry, should have taken a picture at this point).. The next weekend, we removed the bracing and covered over the top of the concrete with the dirt we removed from the holes. The cardboard tubes were a bit proud of the ground, but those can be trimmed later (I intend to pave that side yard eventually, so I just left them proud for now).  Finally, we put the 5"" diameter ducting down over the posts.  NOTE:  trying to set the ducting into a round shape was infuriating until I looked up a video on the easiest way to do it.  We had to sand down the corners on the posts in a few places in order to adjust the placement of the ducting on the post.  I thought we would need to secure the ducting with a screw or two, but it holds tight with just a friction fit.. Next item was the roof ridge.  We placed the metal fittings on top of the 4x4 posts without screws and set the 8 ft long 2x6 on top so that we could check to see if it was level (of course it wasn't).  Based on the reading, we trimmed a post and then fixed the fittings and the 2x6 in place with screws.. Looking at the structure, I decided to add another 2x4 immediately underneath the roof ridge to a) add stability and b) provide a wider surface upon which to mount the electrical conduit pipe that would hold the bird feeders.  So we used L-brackets to mount the 2x4 with the 4 inch side against the bottom of the 2x6.  This meant that we were forcing two metal fittings into a very small space on each end, but we managed to squeeze them in.  In hindsight, I am sure there is a much easier and cleaner solution for this.  Afterwards, we screwed up from the bottom of the 2x4 into the 2x6 and that provided some much needed rigidity to the structure.. Finally, we trimmed the metal conduit pipe to fit within the posts using an angle grider, then mounted it using the EMT straps.  By using large EMT straps and pushing the ends together a bit, the pipe is able to hang down about an inch below the 2x4.  We then hung a large sunflower feeder, a hummingbird feeder, and a nyger seed feeder on the pipe using S-hooks.  The use of S-hooks on the pipe allow for the greatest flexibility of hanging options.  Early customers to the feeders seemed quite comfortable with the structure so far.. Now we could move on to the roof.  Reading up on how to do roofing in regular construction books and online, I found shed instructions to be the most helpful (probably because they were working with small, light structures).  I couldn't find anything specific on the type of roof I wanted, so I just made it up (apologies to those people who know about roofing!).. Now we already had a fixed measurement on the roof panels:  2ft x 8 ft (the two halves of the original 4x8x3/4 panel).  This drove all of our remaining roof measurements. Eyeballing the angle with a 2ft piece of plywood scrap, I determined that I wanted the roof to be between a 5/12 pitch (it would drop 5 inches for every 12 inches of run) and a 6/12 pitch (it would drop 6 inches for every 12 inches of run).  That would be sufficient to protect the feeders, but not obscure the view of them.  I also decided to use 2 inches of the 24 inch width of the plywood to act as an overhang.. Now using the Pythagorean Theorem - in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides - I determined that my existing roof panel (24 inches minus 2 inches of overhang) was essentially the hypotenuse.  Based on that calculation, I set the crossbar (the b of the calculation) down approximately 8 inches below the top of the roof ridge.  We secured the crossbar on each side with screws, then cut two 2x4s to connect them.  This essentially created a ""box"".. The 8ft length of plywood needed to be supported, so we placed three rafters on each side of the roof ridge.  The first rafter we cut from 1x4.  Based on the earlier calculation, we cut the rafter to approximately 23"", mounted a joist hanger on one end and then held it up in place to determine where the ""birds mouth"" cut would be to have it sit on the ""box"".  We also marked where the end of the rafter needed to be trimmed so that it would be in alignment with the plywood top.  Once we had this template rafter, we cut the remaining two for the one side of the structure.  Everything was then screwed into place.  We repeated the same process for the other side (we had to adjust our measurements slightly for the other side).. We placed one plywood piece on top of the rafters and screwed it into place.  Then we did the same with the other plywood piece on the other side.  There was a slight gap where the boards butted against each other over the roof ridge, but that would later be covered by the roofing materials.. Then we measured out two pieces of roofing paper approximately 9ft in length.  We centered one piece over one side of the structure and made sure there was approximately 5 inches of overhang at the bottom and enough at the top to cover over the gap to the other plywood piece.  This was stapled in place along the top first to hold it while we shaped the other sides to wrap around the plywood pieces.  We tried to make all the corners look as neat as possible, then stapled everything in place.  We repeated this process on the other side of the roof.. I went to one of the local DIY stores for my supplies and found the shingles which were close to the color of the shingles on the house.  There was a broken package of shingles on the floor and they agreed to sell it to me for $10 (60% off!).  . I read up on how to attach shingles, and followed their instructions (mostly).  So we started by trimming a starter row of shingles and put that at the bottom of the panel, then laid the first row of shingles on top of that row.  We then staggered the next two rows of shingles. The other roof panel was done the exact same way.  Finally, we covered the roof ridge.  We didn't use specific shingles for the roof ridge.  Instead, we just used individual shingles to cover the roof ridge.. Now because we used a broken package of asphalt shingles we were probably one row short on each side of the roof, however I don't think it is detrimental to the structure since the panels are completely covered.  The effect is mostly ""cosmetic"".  . The shelter has now been in use for several months and it has worked very well.  I am able to change out the feeders easily, the food stays dry, and the birds are comfortable with the structure.  The only design issue we've had is with water occasionally dripping down the roofing paper in heavy rain, but that is not really going to damage the structure.  Beyond that, it can be a bit dark under the structure, so I am going to add a cheap string of solar lights to the inside so that the birds are easier to see.. Did you make this project?

                . Yes, I have a healthy squirrel population here.  At the moment, they are jumping from the nearby fence to the roof of the feeder stand and then they have access to the end feeders.  The pipe on the uprights really limits their access.   If I didn't have the fence (or other close launching point), they would not be able to access the stand.  . I am stuck with the limitations of the site, so I have a ""sacrifice"" feeder stocked with the cheapest seed mix I can find for the squirrels off to the side which is easier to raid.... © 2020 Autodesk, Inc..

" I saw this funnel and I was inspired to make an awesome bird feeder out of it. I wanted it to look like something my grandparents would have bought at the feed store in the 1930's. With a little searching, I was able to find the rest of what I needed to complete it with the look I envisioned. This is an easy to build project from ready-made parts that can be sourced at most home or hardware stores. It can be completed in an hour or two with simple tools. I like the farm store/industrial/grain silo look and I know that it will look good for lot longer than most feeders you can buy.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. The Tools you will need are as follows.. Drill. step drill bit or a set of drill bits 1/16"" to 3/16"". rivet gun. carpenters square. flexible measuring tape. center punch. T-reamer (optional). dull side cutting pliers. sharpie. grinder with cut off blade (not sawzall as pictured, more on this later) . tubing cutter (optional). Here are the materials you will need.. big metal funnel (tractor supply has these). 8x6 duct reducer (any home store should have these). pie plate from the thrift store (it should be of smaller diameter than the funnel so water won't drip in). 1 3/8"" fence cap (you might have to get this at a fencing store, the home stores don't carry it) . 1/4"" copper tubing 6""-8"" long . 1/16"" cable (old bicycle brake cable will work). 1/16"" ferrules. small fender washers. 3/16"" x 1/8"" rivets (aluminum). metal plumbing tape (pre-punched holes means no drilling or measuring). First we need to cut the end of the funnel off so that the cap will fit. It also makes the opening bigger so that it is easier to fill the feeder with birdseed.. An easy way to transfer the diameter of the cap to the funnel is to make a template out of card stock. After you have traced the circle make sure to draw the actual cut line about 1/4"" to 3/8"" higher so there will be something sitting inside the cap. . Cutting with a sawzall was not the best way to do this. It jumped around and shook and made a pretty uneven cut. I have used a grinder with a cutoff wheel on something like this before and would recommend it as a much better method. A hacksaw might work if that's what you have.. Using the center punch, mark two points where you want to drill holes for the cables that will suspend your feeder.  Look inside before doing  this to avoid drilling through the thick part of the funnel neck. Now drill with a bit  slightly bigger than the cable.. This is the part that keeps the cables separated so they don't hit the top of the feeder. Cut the tubing long enough so that when it is bent to the desired width, the ends will point straight down. Six to eight inches is about right. I used a tubing cutter and a reamer but a hacksaw would work. Next bend it around a round object that is the size you need. I used the front of my drill.. Pass the cable through the cable separator. Push the cable end into the funnel. Put a washer and a ferrule on it. Crimp the ferrule with a pair of cutters, the duller the better, you don't want to cut, you want to smash. Do this on both sides. . Unfortunately, there will be math on this project. Measure around the duct, divide by three. Whew, I'm glad that's over. I used the metric side of the tape to make it easier. Mark the three points with a sharpie. Use the square to mark 3/4"" down from the top to keep things even. Now use a square to transfer the measurement to the bottom of the duct so you don't have to do math again!. Plumbers tape breaks with a little back and forth bending. Bend a piece that has three small holes.  Break it off and repeat. You'll need six pieces the same size. If the  rivets are a little bit too big for the holes, ream them so they fit.. Center punch the three marks at the top of the duct. Using the step bit, drill to 3/16"". It's pretty easy to drill too far in sheet metal and make a hole bigger than you wanted, so when it starts to go through the metal, stop pushing. For some reason the 3/16"" rivets didn't fit in the 3/16"" hole I drilled so a half twist with the reamer made it work. Now pop those straps on.. For this step it's helpful to put the funnel in a can, bucket or flower pot to hold it while you work. Use a square to center the duct on the funnel. The trick is to keep adjusting until it's the same measurement all the way around. When it looks like it's centered, make some marks so it will be easy to put it back.  Make a dot with the sharpie in the center of each end hole in the strap. When you're satisfied with the marks, punch and drill just like before. . Put the top and bottom together  and push a rivet through the holes. You can put one hand inside and hold them together while you squeeze the rivet tool with the other hand. Make sure the strap is pushed all the way down on the rivet before you squeeze the handle.. The duct should hang a little below the rim of the pie pan so it will stay full of seed but not spill out. To do this, we will first bend the straps in the solid part just above the small hole on the end. Pliers make this easier. Now hold one of them against the bottom of the duct with the distance of the desired gap sticking out. Mine was about an inch, yours will depend on the depth of the pie plate you found.  Make a dot on the duct in the small hole at the top of the strap. Use the square to transfer this measurement to the other marks.   Punch and drill just like before. . To center the duct on the pie plate, use the same trick with the square from step ten.  Transfer the three marks from the duct onto the plate. Now measure in a about 1/2"" from where you marked the duct. (I used the holes in the plumbers tape as a tape measure.)  This is where you will drill.  . Center punch and drill three holes. Test to see if the rivets fit, ream if necessary.. Rivet the straps to the inside of the duct with the bent part facing down.. For the last step, put the funnel in the can like in step ten. Lining up the holes can be tricky because you can't put your hand inside at this point. It will help if you put a rivet in the holes one at a time. It takes two squeezes to pop a rivet. I did one squeeze on each rivet and went back around a second time and finished it. For a finishing touch, clean off the sharpie with a Q-tip and alcohol.. There you have it, a bird feeder that looks cool and will last forever. The best way to fill it is with a funnel. If you worry about moisture getting in you could put a tiny blob of silicone on the holes where the cables go through, then pull them tight while it dries. I didn't feel the need to do this as the steep roof will shed water quickly. I remember in the past 3/16"" rivets fitting into the holes in plumbers tape, maybe things have changed or my memory is wrong, but it's not too hard to make them fit.  .

" The idea to build this log cabin bird house came after storm Ophelia passed over Ireland on the 16th October 2017 causing a lot of damage to property and also uprooting and knocking trees. During a brief let up in the winds I ventured outside  for a look around only to hear and see  a hedge nearby alive with birds taking  shelter from the storm.  I don't know if they were frightened or if it was the sheer number of them but the noise they were making was deafening. I would never cut down a tree to make a bird house so I spent some time the following day collecting small branches and sticks that had been broken or had fallen during the storm.

I started off by cutting a piece of the pallet wood to 8 inches (200 mm) x 6 inches (150 mm). This piece will eventually become the floor of the bird house but to start I will use it to set the size of the cabin. Using my tenon saw for a finer cut, I cut a number of pieces of sticks for the front, back and sides.. Next using a utility knife I striped all the bark from the sticks. The sticks I used were from a mix of 3 trees. Ash, hazelnut but I don't know what the third type was. The bark came away easily as the wood was still very fresh.. I set the sticks around the pallet wood base and marked the intersections where they cross over with a pencil.. I then marked a curve to half the width of the sticks and set about carefully cutting out the curve with a sharp utility knife. This process does take a bit of time. I test fitted the joints as I went and did adjustments where required.. When I was happy with the joints I applied a little exterior wood glue before nailing it with a panel pin in each joint.. Once the first set of logs (sticks) were pinned it was just a matter of fitting each log in the same way as before until I reached the height I was happy with. For the entrance I fitted a log as normal and then cut the ope before pinning it. For the last two logs on each side I left then about a half inch longer, this was to create an overhang for the roof.. The roof pitch is somewhere around 25-30 degrees. I cut a few rafters and pinned them together before attaching them to cabin. I was going to add more rafters but felt it did not need them as these rafters were going to be attached to the gables and this would be good enough to hold the roof. For the gable logs I marked them off the rafters to get the correct angle to cut them. I then pinned them in the same way as before.. I needed something to support the grass roof so i used some pallet wood I had. Using a hatchet I cut off the edge to form a miter along the ridge where the two pieces of the wood would meet. You don't really have to do this as it will all eventually be covered but I did.  When I was happy with the fit I attached all the pieces of wood for the roof using panel pins.. I added some trim/fascia also make from sticks all around the edge of the roof . This was to hide the edges of the grass when it was fitted and also to hide the edges of the pallet wood i used for the roof.. At this stage I attached the base that I had cut earlier. I just used longer panel pins to do this. I may need to remove the base again  some time to clean the inside and it should be easy enough to it by removing the pins I put in.. To help protect the wood and waterproof the cabin I stapled on some polythene and then  some chicken wire. This was to hopefully prevent the grass sod from slipping on the polythene. I trimmed off some of the extra polythene at this stage.. I went to a corner of my garden, far away from view and using a knife I cut up some grass sod. Take your time doing this and peel a little at a time until it is removed. Place the sod onto the roof and gently pack it into place and cut off any excess. I am not entirely sure how well the grass roof will hold up over time. It should be fine for autumn, winter & spring in Ireland anyway but I fear in the summer months it will dry out if not watered. Time will tell.. And this is it! The finished log cabin bird house. I hope you like it and maybe have a go making one. It is an easy project to make using only a few hand tools but it will require a little patience when doing the joints. This will probably be the biggest log cabin I will ever get to make so I think that's why I spent the time doing all the joints where I could have came up with something a lot quicker and easier to make. I am glad I spent the time making it and am very happy with the result and I think it was a good way to use some of the fallen wood from the storm. The rest will probably end up in my stove!.

" Birds don’t like soggy sunflower seeds!  . I live on Vancouver Island on the west coast of Canada where the winters are mild but can be quite wet.  In the past I have had to dispose of a lot of wet, moldy birdseed and clean out the feeders.  In this Instructable I am upcycling an old satellite dish and using it as a rain shelter for my birdfeeder.. The feeder originally hung from a tree on a wire and even though the feeder did have a bit of a roof on it the fill hatch at the top didn’t seal very well.  In order to employ the satellite dish effectively I decided to mount both the dish and feeder on a fence post; this involved constructing a bracket to support the feeder from the bottom.. This is a fairly easy project and can be accomplished by anyone with even very basic maker skills.  The project can be completed in 1 day although if paint is involved allow 2 days.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. 1    Orphaned satellite dish. 1    Bird feeder with 3/4” post mount hole in the bottom. 2    step washers (3/4” shoulder with 1/2” step and ¼” through hole). 1    ½” EMT conduit pipe x 1” long. 1    2-1/2” x ¼” bolt. 1    ¼” nut. 3    ¼” flat washers. 1    ¼” fender washer. 1    ¼” lock washer. 1    1” x ¼” x 14 ¼” piece flat iron. 1    1” x ¼” x 6 ¾” piece flat iron. 1    3/8” x 3 ½” piece of rebar, cut on 45 degree at each end. 4    #14 x 2” pan head wood screws. With exception to the welding (optional) most of the project is doable with very common shop tools:. . Start out by modifying the satellite dish arm to allow it to mount closer to the post.  To accomplish this simply cut the curved part of the pipe off (you can use a hacksaw or, as I did, a zip disc on a handheld grinder).  Being as the dish will be mounted with the back skyward it is a good idea to drill a small hole in the bottom lip so collected rain water can drain away.. Next cut away the two tails that extend from the back of the dish beyond the lip.  Cut them flush with lip on dish. This ensures the dish will fit close to fence post.. I used 1” x ¼” flat iron to form the bracket but there are plenty of options here including a purchased bracket from the hardware.. Cut two pieces of iron; The horizontal piece 14 ¼” and then drill a ¼” hole at one end (1” from end) for attaching the peg to support the feeder, the vertical piece of iron is cut to 6 ¾” and drill two ¼” holes in one end (one at 1” and the other at 3 ½”).  The two pieces were welded together at a 90 degree angle (weld the ends without the holes).  I also welded a short piece of 3/8” rebar as a corner brace but wouldn’t have been necessary.. Assemble the peg; insert 1 step washer on the ¼” bolt followed by the 1” piece of ½” EMT, then the other step washer, then the 3 flat washers and finally the fender washer.  This assembly is then inserted into the ¼” hole in the horizontal leg of the bracket, pointing upward.  Slip the ¼” lock washer over the end of the bolt and attach the assembly with the ¼” nut.  Tighten.. This is a good time to spray paint the bracket (I used a grey color somewhat close to the feeder and satellite dish).. While the bracket is drying install the satellite dish.  Locate it fairly high on the post, the feeder has to nestle up under it.   I used large #14 x 2” screws so predrilled with a 1/8” drill bit. Tilt the front of the dish upward slightly so collected water runs back toward the drain hole drilled earlier.  Leave the adjustment screws on the dish bracket snug but not too tight, this allows you to tilt the dish up easily to fill the feeder.. Once the bracket is dry you might need to wrap a couple layers of electrical tape on the peg to provide a snug fit with the hole in the bottom of the birdfeeder.  With the feeder sitting on the bracket, hold the bracket up on the fence post below the dish, mark the location of the mounting holes and predrill with 1/8” bit.  Next install the bracket with two #14 x 2” screws and set the birdfeeder in place on the peg.  To fill the feeder you simply push the dish upward on its bracket, remove the fill cap on the feeder and pour in the seed.. Was this a perfect solution?  Not quite, the rain is sometimes accompanied by wind; a little wind is no problem but gusts still tend to blow rain into the feeder although a lot less than before.. I hope you found this Instructable helpful and even if didn’t have a satellite dish to upcycle you at least found inspiration for creating your own birdfeeder shelter solution (perhaps from other upcycled material like hub caps, garbage can lids or cooking wok).. Thanks for taking the time to read my Instructable, it is my first and as such may qualify for a win in the ‘First Time Author’ contest.

" Why my interest in a new nest box design?. I inherited an interest in birds from my father, whose family grew up next door to a bird expert.  Ruth Thomas studied and banded birds and wrote, “Crip, Come Home” as well as, “Brush Goat, Milk Goat” and a weekly column on birds in the 1940s in the Arkansas Democrat Newspaper.  Many of my relatives have fed birds (including hummingbirds) and land-lorded Purple Martins and Bluebirds.  I finally upgraded to property that lent itself to land-lording in 1998.  My plastic Purple Martin gourds last forever, while my Bluebird houses have been replaced many times over the years.  In researching PVC as an option, I ran into the Gilbertson design but thought it was overly complex and had some risk for dropping the nest-box onto the ground, so I designed my own nest-boxes and put them into use in 2016.  With only 1.5 acres for 5 nest-boxes, 2017 saw 13 Bluebirds and 20 House Wrens fledged from the new boxes.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Advantages:. PVC post – Entire assembly can be moved inside for winter if desired (may extend product life). PVC vs Wood Nest Box – Cheaper, fewer parts, easier to make and assemble, longer life. Moose vs Gilbertson – Cheaper, fewer parts, easier to make and assemble, heavier and better insulated.                   Supported from bottom, so no risk of nest-box falling from a top-suspension design. Slit vs Round opening – No sparrows, easier feeding of older nestlings. Mobile, vented floor – No moisture, fly larvae may fall through, easy to expel spent nest. Removable Roof – Easy viewing and photography of nestlings. Removable Nest Box – Easy viewing and cleaning. Bucket Guard – Cheaper than metal and no seams with exposed screws for climbing snakes. 3.5”x36” Steel U-Post.              2”x5’ PVC pipe Post.             4” to 2” PVC adapter.             4”x6” PVC pipe Nest Box.             4” Qwik Cap.             3.75x3.75” hardware “cloth” floor.             6” carriage bolt floor anchor.             .67”x11.25”x12” roof.             5-gallon bucket predator guard. Table saw and/or Sabre Saw. Xacto Knife. Trauma Sheers or Tin Snips. 2.25"" hole saw. Hand Drill and Screwdriver. Post Driver or Sledge Hammer. Pre-assembly instructions (see pictures):. 1)      Cut 11-12” Square Roof and glue it to rubber Quick Cap . (gorilla glue is good but expands when curing; use knife when done to cut away excess glue). 2)      Cut two pieces of hardware cloth and assemble with 6-8” centered bolt. Bolt works as center-weight to keep floor from tilting and as plunger to expel spent nests . 3) Cut 4” PVC to 6” length; cut 2.5x1.25” entrance slot into Quick Cap with Xacto Knife. 4) Put Quick Cap onto Nest-Box and trace opening to cut matching entrance to Nest-Box . 5) Cut two 1.75”, vertical, ventilation slits opposite the entrance slot from upper edge of Nest-Box. (slits will extend ~1/2” below Quick Cap when roof is in place). 5)      Cut 2” PVC post to ~5’ length . 6)      If planning to add predator guard inverted bucket  . a.      Use hole saw to cut 2.25” hole in bottom of bucket  . b.      Measure ~11” down from top of post and wrap masking tape around post; make it level  . c.       Drill 1st hole along upper edge of tape  . d.      Measure 2.5” to left and right of hole to mark 2nd and 3rd holes for screws  . e.      Screw in the three short screw so screw-heads project a few mm. 1)     Choose a location. 2)      Place a post smaller than 2”; U-posts and retired chain-link posts work well. 3)      Cover with 2” PVC post ~5’ tall. 4)      Slide optional inverted bucket guard until suspended by 3 screws in post. 5)      Add 2” to 4” PVC converter. 6)      Add 4” PVC Nest Box. 7)      Add hardware cloth base to Nest Box and cover with pine-needles. 8)      Add 4” Qwik Cap to top of Nest Box with entry slit matching Nest Box slit . (11-12” roof glued to top of Qwik Cap in pre-assembly). 10)  Gelstain post & nest if wanting to blend better with landscape. (Stain inside of nestbox during pre-assembly if wanting darker interior). With just one nest box, I usually get 2-3 broods of bluebirds each year with an average of 5 eggs per brood.  With several boxes, I often have two active nests at a time despite the territorial nature of bluebirds in a 1.5 acre space.  I can have 10-20 babies fledging per year, so over the past 20 years here, we have had more than 300 bluebirds fledge.  The chickadees and house-wrens also like the boxes.. This year with the new box design, we fledged six chickadees (only one brood per year), 20 house-wrens, and 13 bluebirds. The wrens and bluebirds are quite welcome, since anything that eats insects on my property is an asset.. There were no snake attacks. I have had three over the years, so decided to add the buckets during my upgrade this year. We have black rat snakes that are quite talented in getting to nests, and we also have raccoons and squirrels. The slot near the roof has kept out the starlings, but in the wooden boxes, we still got sparrows at times. This year, the new design didn't seem to interest the sparrows at all.. .

" My wife wanted a bird bath on our balcony.  Unlike a traditional pedestal bird bath, we don't have a garden hose nearby to clean it; so it needs to be easily and quickly removable for taking inside to clean.  We also live in a condo, so we can't permanently affix it to certain parts of the building. This is my solution.  PVC stand affixed to the balcony railings, with a removable bath.. Parts. Tools . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. The basin is going to need to be screwed in and out of place for cleaning, so you want it high enough that it clears the deck railings.  . Measure the height in the railings and add an inch or two as desired (the top connector is going to a little height as well).. Mark a cut line on the PVC to the height you determined in the previous step.  Using a hacksaw, chop saw, or radial arm saw cut the PVC pipe to length along the cut line.  Just make sure it's a straight 90 degree cut, otherwise the connectors may not fit properly.. Before cementing the connectors in place, you should clean the PVC pipe so they will adhere correctly.  Goo Gone and a paper towel worked well enough.. Check the fittings of the cap and threaded plug to ensure they fit correctly.  What I didn't do, but should have, take some painters tape and cover the threads inside of the threaded plug.  This will prevent the possibility of the glue/cement getting into the threads.. Following the directions on the primer/glue, and only install once connector at a time. Wearing protective gloves, apply a thin coating of the primer inside the connector and outside the pipe.  Apply an additional thin coating of the glue over the primer, and push the connector onto the pipe (without twisting it).  Wipe off an excess glue.. Repeat with the other connector on the other side of the pipe.. The Gorilla PrimaGlue worked for me in this step, but depending on the material of the basin you chose you may need to opt for a different glue. Apply a thin coat of primer to both surfaces.  Then apply a thin coating of glue/cement to both surfaces and attach them (push, don't twist).  Depending on the glue you may need to apply pressure for the bond to adhere.. Scrape off any sticker/labels and remove the adhesive residue with the Goo Gone.  . Use the painters tape to tape off the opening of the threaded plug, so you don't get paint or primer on the threads. Apply spray primer to the PVC pipe. Apply additional coats as needed.  Apply a spray paint as desired.. I temporarily used packing tape to adhere mine in place.  My 8"" zip ties were insufficient.  14"" fit well once I bought them.  You can measure the diameter for your installation to find what will work best.  Two or 3 points of attachment should work well.  Once it is firmly in place (and not rotating), you can screw the basin into the top.  Fill with water. Now wait for birds to actually find it.. Maybe birds don't like translucent baths two stories up?  I took the bath down, masked off the screw threads, and painted the outside. . Maybe too late in the season, I've only managed to get one photo (of poor quality) of birds checking the bath out so far.. Participated in the Outside Contest 2017.

" When your friends or family have an empty wine box like this one and they don't know what to do with it, you can turn it into a great bird house! All you need is a small wine box and a wooden dowel to get started.Other materials you will need are:- a pencil- a ruler- a small saw- a drill- drill bits- scissors- a thin but strong rope to hang it by- a backyard for the bird house*the dowel should be about 1/2 an inch in diameter and be at least 4 inches long. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. A) Slide the lid off the box and pull out the handle.B) Flip the box upside down.C) Saw your wooden dowel so that it is 4 inches long.D) Mark where 2 inches below the existing hole in the box is.E) Start drilling by making a small hole with a small drill bit, and then change your drill bit so that you are using one which has a slightly smaller diameter than your dowel.F) See if the dowel fits through the the new hole you drilled, and if it almost fits then take a hammer and hit it into the hole far enough that the wooden dowel doesn't move.. A) Put the lid back on the box and drill two holes in the lid centered about 3 inches apart. You should make the holes wide enough for your rope to fit through.C) Maneuver the lid half open with both holes still on the inside of the box, then thread the rope through the holes.D) Cut and tie the rope at whatever length you think will fit your trees or bushes best.. You can put twigs or leaves inside your birdhouse if you want, but the birds will change their nest to how they want it to be. And if birds aren't attracted to it, consider building a bird feeder nearby.Enjoy watching birds make their home!. Participated in the MacGyver Challenge. Participated in the Box Contest 2017.

" In India, birds like sparrows have notable decrease in number. In summer the temperature exceeds over 48 degree Celsius at midday. We can't see any birds at that time. So I decided to make a birdhouse for birds. The Birdhouse is recycled and harmless to Birds. Small Birds like Sparrow can play on it and eat their food beating the heat. It is made up of Small Coke can.. NOTE: 1. The Birdhouse should not be kept in direct sunlight . Can will heat and it will be unsuitable for Birds..        2. Big Birds like pigeon can cause imbalance and can pour all your loaded food.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. 1. Can of any size . 2. 2 Zip Ties. 3. Rope. 4. Cutter which can cut the can. 5. Small piece of wood. You can get it from a carpenter.. 6. Dish wash liquid. Cut the mouth of can with the help of cutter. . The cut portion may harm Birds. So please make it safe by polishing its endpoints.. Now, wash the inner side of can with dish wash bar as the sugar remained inside the can can also attract insects.. Now, with two zip ties make the T-shape as shown in Image 1. Then attach with can with piece of wood as shown in Image 2.. Insert the rope in Zip tie so that we can hang it.. Hang it at place where it will be protected from sunlight and add bird food..

"I have 33 trees on my property and tons of wild birds. Most of them live in the very tops of the trees where I can't see them come and go very well. I like to keep birdhouses in the trees closest to the house so I can watch and enjoy the birds.. If you have the tools already living in your workshop/garage one birdhouse will cost a little under $7.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. If you are new to working with PVC and want more in-depth information I highly recommend enrolling in the PVC Class taught by audreyobscura!. You will need the following tools and materials to make a PVC birdhouse. (If you have access to a CNC machine this would be SO much easier. You could cut precise wooden circles with cutouts for the front and back of the birdhouse. A different saw would also make this much faster, however, I am a gal with limited access to tools!!). . Tools & Materials. 1. Measure and mark an 8 inch long section of PVC. Mine came in two foot lengths so I ended up making three birdhouses (they make great gifts!). Draw a diagonal line at an angle of your choice starting at the 8 inch mark. Mine was approximately 60 degrees.. . 2. Clamp the PVC to a work table and using a handsaw cut along the angle. As always, tools can be dangerous. Please use caution.. . . . 3. Using a metal file, smooth down the cut edge removing any bits.. . 4. Sand the entire surface with the 100 grit sandpaper. This will remove the words/lettering on the PVC and prepare it for painting. Be sure to rough up the entire surface including the inside of the cut angle.. . Each of the wooden rounds will need holes drilled. The front piece will need the main hole for the bird to fit through and the back piece will need a few vent holes.. I purchased these wooden rounds at Michael's for $.99 each. They are beveled and about 3/4 inch thick. I wish they weren't that thick but they worked for this application. If you can find thinner ones use those! This was overkill.. 1. Using an electric drill fitted with a 1 1/4 inch drill bit, drill a hole in one of the rounds positioning it toward one side (not in the middle).. . 2. Change the drill bit to 1/4 inch and drill a hole half way through the wood. Position it right under the larger hole This will be for the perch later. (You can see in the image that I failed to drill this before painting...big mistake! don't forget this step before painting! The paint just chips off around the hole and will have to be repainted.). . 3. On the other wooden round, mark where three vent holes should go, I lined them up along the top edge in a row. Change the drill bit to 1/8 inch and drill the holes.. . . ***To avoid chipping the wood you can place a piece of tape on the wood before drilling and drill through the tape. The wood I used was really soft, but if you used something harder it probably wouldn't require taping and wouldn't chip so bad. I did one each way and the one I didn't tape chipped really bad (I had to fill it with wood putty). Boo.. . . Choose two paint colors that you like. One for the PVC and one for the front and back pieces. . 1. In a well ventilated area on a covered work surface, or spray booth, spray paint the PVC. Don't forget the back edge! Let dry according to paint can directions.. . . 2. Spray the wooden rounds. Let dry thoroughly.. . . 3. Cut a 2 1/2 inch piece of dowel and paint desired color(s).. . If you have a CNC machine the sanding part of this step won't be necessary. The wooden rounds I purchased weren't actually 4 inches so they had to be sanded to fit inside the PVC.. 1. Using 220 grit sandpaper sand down the edges until the rounds fit in either side of the body of the birdhouse. Dry fit them to assure a good fit.. . . 2. Run a bead of glue (I used Weldbond) around the flat edge of the birdhouse.. . . 3. Inset the back side piece of wood to secure in place.. . 4. Using a quick square measure to find where the front of the wooden round will sit and mark with a pencil. This will tell you where to run the bead of glue.. . . 5. Run a bead of glue. My pieces fit really tight so I used a mallet to gently pound the wooden face into place.. . . 6. Squeeze a dab of glue into the hole on the face and secure the dowel for the perch.. . More drilling coming up!. 1. Fit your drill with a 5/64 inch drill bit (or what matches your eye screws) and drill two holes on the top of the birdhouse. One toward the front and one toward the back. It might be tempting to just put one hole in the center, however, the birdhouse won't hang evenly once a bird decided to nest in it.. . 2. Twist in the eye screws until they are secure. I matched up the front eye screw with the wood to secure it further.. . 3. If your paracord isn't already cut, cut a 24 inch piece and burn the edge with a lighter to prevent fraying.. . 4. Thread it through the eye screws and tie a knot to join the ends.. . 5. Hang in a tree and enjoy!. . Participated in the Box Contest 2017. Participated in the Outside Contest 2017. "
" Years ago, my son bought me this birdhouse for Christmas. He found it at his school Bazaar, paid 50 cents, and gave it to me knowing I love ""make it pretty"" projects. At the time however, I had a cat who was a very proficient hunter, and felt bad louring birds to their death. He has since passed away, and I just remembered about the birdhouse that has been waiting patiently to get beautified.  . I have some fake dollar store flowers, scrap booking paper and mountains of glitter, so I decided today is the day I get this project finished!. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. First you need a birdhouse. This one seemed to be a first attempt, maybe from a kid? It's heavy and well assembled, just not aligned completely. Also, my dog chewed on the perch, so I'll have to fix that.. You will need white multi-purpose glue, a paintbrush, scrapbooking paper, a knife,a cup to mix with, scissors, large Popsicle sticks, Guesso, glue (I used gorilla, you can use Krazy glue or anything sturdy), a hard plastic straw, fake flowers, glitter, glitter paint, sticky gems, sparkle tape.. Mix the multipurpose white glue with water at a 50:50 ratio. . Paint this mixture over the side of the birdhouse. . Place a piece of scrapbooking paper flush against the top edge and smooth down.. Using scissors or a knife, cut the excess paper and press down the edges.. Repeat on other side.. I needed to replace the perch anyway, so I cut it off with the knife before I applied the paper.. Paint on the glue/water mixture.. Place the paper firmly against the wood and trim the excess.. I ripped the top of my paper and needed to patch it up. I used a corner of the same design paper and cut along the edges of one of the flowers, then pressed it into place and smoothed it down with more glue/water.. The get the entrance hole, I poked my fingers through and painted the edges down with more glue/water.. Using the same technique as the sides and front, glue the paper onto the roof.. I used a different pattern on each side.. The side with flowers had leaves that extended past the center so I cut them out and using some of the glue/water mixture, smoothed them down over the plain side.. I tried gluing a different pattern of paper on the wood edges, but it was too rough and textured for anything to stick. I therefor applied a heavy coating of Guesso, and will use glitter paint on it after the Guesso dries. Birds like glitter right?. For the new perch, I was looking for a chopstick, but instead found an old (but very solid) wiggly straw.. Cut the straight part off the straw and glue it beneath the entrance. Hold it tight until the glue is dry enough that you can leave it without it tipping over.. When the glue is completely dry, cut off a single flower from the bouquet of plastic dollar store flowers. Place the stem into the hole in the straw.. Take 5 very large Popsicle sticks (you can get them in almost any craft section), and lay them lined up on a flat surface. . Cover the bottom of the birdhouse in glue and place it gently on top of the sticks. . Add more glue to the front of the Popsicle sticks (to help hold them together).. When the glue is still wet, place assorted flowers against the front of the house.. Wrap glitter tape around the perch if you don't like the color of the straw.. Paint the edges of the roof with glitter paint.. Paint the Popsicle sticks with glitter paint.. Sprinkle glitter over the ""garden"".. Press sticky back gems around the entrance.. Paint over the entire birdhouse with a layer of the glue/water mixture.. Let dry.. Participated in the Before and After Contest 2017. "
" One of the problems I always had with bird feeders is they get all nasty when it rains.  The seed gets wet and clumps and you have to take the feeder down, clean it out and let it dry before putting it back up.. This is my solution.  Easy to make with almost no tools, very inexpensive, and the birds love it.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Start by getting a bowl or dish shaped bottom to hold the birdseed.  It can be most anything you want.  The one in my example appears to be a small jell-o mold.  I picked it up at the Goodwill store for 99 cents.  The top is a larger and shallower shape.  It will be upside-down on the feeder, so make sure it will not hold rainwater.  Other things you might try would be metal pot and pan lids or Frisbees – use your imagination and your feeder will be unique.. Cut a support piece from a dowel or broomstick.  It might be fun to use a straight section of tree branch for a rustic look.  Eyeball the length of this support piece (no measuring required).  It should be long enough for birds to get to the food tray, but short enough so that windblown rain won’t wet the seed.. The hard part is putting holes in the top and bottom pieces.  In my example, the bottom green dish is soft plastic and I could easily drill a hole.  I could also have just poked a hole with a hammer and nail, but I wanted to show off.  Don’t make your hole too big – just large enough for your screw to go through.. My top piece was hard plastic.  Drilling it would crack the plastic, so I just heated a nail with a propane torch and melted a hole.  If you don't have a torch, a lighter will work.  Just don’t burn yourself.. I used an ice pick to put starter holes in the top and bottom of the dowel.  A small nail would also work to get the screw started. Like the nail I used to melt the hole in the top.  Be careful not to stab yourself.  You don't need to make a deep hole, just enough to get the screw started.. You will need a hanger for your bird feeder.  If you have a screw eye, you could just use that.  I didn’t have one, so I made a hanger from a bit of wire using needle nose pliers.  You could use a piece of a coat hanger for this.  If you don’t have needle nose pliers, just wrap the wire around that nail you used earlier to punch the holes.. Now, assemble your feeder.  Careful not to tighten the screws too hard or you might break the plastic. . Fill your feeder with some seed (I used sunflower seed), hang it outside your window, and have fun watching the birds!  I hope you try making your own and have fun with it.. Participated in the Before and After Contest 2017. "
" This is a cheap and easy to make bird feeder for use with apples, oranges and similarly sized fruit. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. The photos show the finished bird feeder. It consists of a vertical ring through which a removable bamboo skewer is fitted for holding the fruit in place. This is zip tied to a horizontal ring, which is also fitted with a (shorter) skewer to prevent the fruit from sliding or turning on the first skewer. The second skewer only needs to enter the fruit a centimeter or so.. The top of the vertical ring is fitted with an eyelet screw for hanging the feeder from a branch or similar with a piece of string or wire.. 1. Two rings made from 2 cm sections of 110 mm PVC waste pipe. I used pipe with a wall thickness of 3 mm for added sturdiness.. 2. Four 150 mm zip ties (you can use shorter, but then tying them will be more difficult).. 3. Two bamboo/wood/plastic/metal skewers.. 4. One eyelet screw.. First cut your two 20 mm sections from a piece of 110 mm waste pipe, preferably with a wall thickness of 3 mm. If you have a band saw available, this step is extremely easy. But even with a jig saw or hand saw there should be no problem.. Drill two holes in each ring opposite each other, as shown in the first picture. The holes should be a little bit larger than the thickness of the skewers. My skewers were 4 mm thick, and accordingly I used a 4.5 mm drill bit.. Drill a smaller hole in the top of the vertical ring for the eyelet screw, according to the thickness of the screw.. Next cut your skewers to size: 170 mm for the longer one, and 110 mm for the shorter one work well. Birds will welcome the protruding ends of the skewers to grab onto.. Nip off the sharp point of the skewers for your and the birds' safety.. If you want to paint your feeder, now is the time. Roughing up the surfaces of the rings with some sanding paper will help the paint adhere.. Loosely fix the two rings to each other with the zip ties as shown in the first picture. The second picture shows the result you should have now. Now adjust the rings so that the holes face in the correct direction, and tighten the zip ties. Cut off the excess lengths of zip tie.. Lastly fix the eyelet screw to the top of the feeder.. Congratulations, your feeder is finished, and can be hanged from a branch. . Birds should flock to it in no time after discovering the treat awaiting them.. "
" This is a variation of the one-board birdhouse available at Lowes.com.  Their plan did not allow for an easy clean-out so I modified the floor and a couple of the joints.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. You will need:. Materials:. 1 ea. 1""x6"" untreated cedar dog-eared fence board.. Interior/exterior glue. #6 x 1-1/4"" screws. Paint (optional). Tools:. Drill with hole saw and 3/32"" & 5/32"" bits. Screwdriver to fit your #6 screws. Saw. Brad nailer and 1-1/4"" brad nails (optional). Tape measure & pencil. Cur the following lengths from your fence board:. 2 ea. 9"" pieces for the roof. 2 ea. 8"" pieces for the ends. 2 ea. 5-1/4"" pieces for the sides.  You can cut these a bit shorter, 5-1/8"", to allow some ventilation under the eaves.. 1 ea. 3-7/8"" piece for the floor. Lowe's cutting diagram for reference.  I changed a couple of things.. https://www.lowes.com/creative-ideas/pdf/One_Board.... For the entrance hole, use an appropriate size for the bird species you want to attract.  Center this on one of your 8"" pieces, 3"" from the bottom.  If you are using a screw to hold the floor in place, center a 5/32"" hole 3/8"" from the bottom edge.  Optionally, you can use a cabinet latch instead of the screw to hold the floor to give the house a no-tools clean out.  If you plan on mounting this on top of a fence post as I did, you'll want to use a screw in the front.  A cabinet latch would be unusable with this type of mounting.  Think ahead, in other words.. Also, drill the 5/32"" holes for the floor hinge screws now in the 5-1/4"" side pieces.  These would be drilled 1"" from the back edge and 3/8"" from the bottom edge.. If you use hummingbird feeders, you can use the scrap entrance hole plug for part of a cheap ant moat,  I have another instructable that covers that.. Cut 45° angles on the front and back pieces.  I use a radial arm saw so I set the beginning of the cut at 5-1/4"" from the bottom edge, cut one side then flip it over and cut the other side.. I bevel the roof pieces and the floor piece with another 45° cut.  I like the way they fit together this way.  Lowe's plan call for a lap joint on the roof.  You can do it this way also.  Trim 3/4"" from one roof piece in lieu of the 45° angle.. The bevel in the floor piece simply eliminates any interference in the floor pivot, but you can simply whittle off some of the back edge of the floor if you find it's binding when opening the floor.. Now you can glue and clamp the front and back to the sides.  After the glue has cured, I put a couple of brad nails on each joint.  Alternatively, you can drill and screw these joints.. At this point you'll want to attach the floor.  It's harder to do after the roof panels are on.  I know.. Move the side of the house to the edge of your workbench and place the floor in position, bevel side down. Through the pre-drilled hole in the bottom corner, drill a 3/32"" pilot hole in the floor piece.  Install this screw loosely.  Repeat for the other side.  Once you're happy with the way the floor is centered, drill the same hole in the front of the floor piece for the latch screw.. A note on painting.  If your house and roof are to be different colors.  Now is the time to paint them separately.. After you have installed the floor, glue on the roof panels and secure them with nails/screws once the glue has cured.  Depending on your glue, you may need to use a couple of pieces of masking tape across the ridge to hold them in place.  I used Loctite PL375 adhesive in a caulking gun and didn't have this problem.. Paint it as you wish!  My barn ad stencil was made by Etsy.com seller Glassy Witch, if you would like this stencil or something custom, look her up on Etsy.  (Check out the Wikipedia page on Harley Warrick as he painted most of the ""Mail Pouch"" barns across the United States.). Enjoy!. If you cut the 45° bevels, you'll have some triangular pieces of scrap on the bench.  You can glue this into the underside of the roof ridge.  If you are drilling into the roof ridge to add eye screws, this just adds a bit more strength.. Another barn art idea I had was to use pop cans as tin signs.  I used carpet tacks to attach them.. "
" I like to shop in resale and thrift stores for dishes, vintage glassware and surprise items. I've seen a lot of vintage lamps with large glass globes in various colors just sitting forlornly on the shelves and wondered what I could make with them, since they weren't very sellable as is. Then one day it hit me - Bird Bath base!. Next you will find my instructable for an easy Bird Bath using various pieces of glass and a pretty lamp base. Enjoy.... Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. First you will need a vintage lamp with some colored glass in the design. You can find one at your nearby thrift or resale shop or at a garage or estate sale Shown is two different lamps that are suitable. I ended up using the first one, with the iridescent globe.. Next you need a shallow bowl, tray or dish made from glass. Again your resale or thrift store or garage or estate sale is a good source for glass with a pretty design and for colored glass. Your bowl should be about 24"" diameter or whatever looks pleasing with your lamp. Also pick up a couple of glass dishes that stack nicely and look well together. Stay away from pieces that have a lot of intricate design that will not sit snugly with your other pieces. . I found this gorgeous vintage lamp with a large iridescent white globe. I already have a pretty good collection of glass serving pieces that would be perfect for a bird bath so I picked one with etched calla lilies.. I love my Dremel 4200 for cutting holes in glass. In fact, I'm on my second one. For this project I will use a Dremel 1/4"" diamond drill bit with Dremel Cutting Oil.. I also need a pair of pliers, a pair of side cutters, Dremel Metal Cutting Wheel with EZ Lock adapter, Dremel Plastic cutting wheel with EZ Lock adapter and a good glue that is weather resistant and waterproof. Loctite and several others make good ones.. I sell my creations and have found out the hard way that  no matter which glue I've used, they eventually fail, which is why I also drill holes and insert a rod to hold everything secure.. Disclaimer: I received NO compensation or recognition from Dremel while I was writing this Instructable. I have no ties or connection to Dremel or any of its employees. I'm entering a contest and hope to win a new Dremel but that hasn't happened during the time I wrote this lesson. I genuinely love my Dremel and use it often. I also have not received anything from Loctite for the above mention. I just happened to have a new tube available. . Since we will be drilling holes in glass you need at least a good pair of Safety Glasses. Your own prescription eyeglasses are not enough. Get a good pair and use them often. Sometimes I use a full face protector so that I'm not inhaling glass dust or getting glass dust on my face.. Wear a pair of gloves that have good gripping since glass gets slippery. Also wear a long sleeved shirt buttoned up to the collar when drilling glass. . I like to use ear plugs when I'm drilling. It's loud and high pitched and I want to keep what hearing I have.. You will also need a stainless steel threaded rod that is 1/4"" diameter and about 36"" long. . I like to use rubber or soft plastic washers and 1/4"" metal washers between the pieces of glass.The amount needed depends on how many pieces of glass you're stacking. Grab a dozen each - you can always use them for your next bird bath. . You also need nuts to fit on your threaded rod. Three should be enough. I forgot to photograph the nuts but you can see one threaded onto the end of the threaded rod. . I added a solar light to this bird bath. You can find those at your local hardware or big box store or dollar store for ,99. . Last but not least you need a topper - something pretty like the splashing bird votive holder I found. I've also used orphan glass lids that are colored or clear, angels, animals, fish, etc. . Remove the lamp shade if your lamp has one. Next remove the harp by pushing up the metal thingeys and squeezing the edges of the harp together. Then lift up. Voila!. Turn your lamp upside down and remove the felted paper that covers the base opening. You won't need it again.. Use your side cutters or a pair of wire cutters to cut the cord. Make sure it isn't plugged in before you do this.. Go back to the top of the lamp. Pull up on the gold fixture. It should reveal a knot of cord wires. Pull them out of the lamp. Easy Peasy.. There is a rod through the middle of the lamp with a threaded area at the top and the bottom. Unscrew the nut at the top using your pliers. . Lift up the pieces of your lamp off the rod then remove the rod from the base piece. Save the rod for another project. . Wash and dry your pieces carefully. . I plan to re-stack the lamp parts the way they were for this design. Using your stainless steel 1/4"" threaded rod place a plastic or rubber washer, metal washer and a 1/4"" nut on the end of the rod.. Finger tighten another 1/4"" nut just above the base piece. See the first picture. . Starting with the base, stack the lamp parts on the 1/4"" rod. Add washers and a nut any place where your parts close around the rod. . Using your Dremel, 1/4"" diamond drill bit and Dremel Cutting Oil drill a centered hole in all the glass pieces that aren't already open. For instance, the large white globe on my lamp has a wide opening so I can leave it as is. . I start with a drop of cutting oil then carefully lower my Dremel bit to create a circle in the glass. I add a drop of oil frequently to keep the area lubricated, which cools the glass and reduces the friction between the glass and the drill bit.. Some people put glass under water to keep it cool while drilling. Others use a drill press and have to rig up a way to cool their glass with water, like spraying it with water or immersing it. I never had any luck with the water cool or the drill press method of drilling glass. I broke a lot of pretty glass and spent hours at the drill press.. That's one of the reasons I love my Dremel 4200. I can drill holes in glass in minutes and I rarely break a piece of glass. I just wish Dremel sold the cutting oil separately because my diamond drill bits last longer then the oil that comes with it.. I chose this small wavey edge glass bowl to go upside down between the lamp part and my bird bath piece, just because it looked nice. Add a metal washer and a rubber washer to the threaded rod then stack that baby on your threaded rod,adding another metal washer and rubber washer.. Glue the glass bowl to the lamp part if you want. I chose not to use glue in this bird bath because the pieces fit together so well and the balance was so good. If I was stacking more glass on glass pieces I would have added a good glue. . Add your large glass bowl or platter for the actual bird bath.. You don't want a piece too deep here. Look around at the birds in your yard. They're bathing in shallow puddles. They don't want to swim. If you've chosen a deep bowl add something to make it shallow - a plate, a pretty lid, an upside down dish. Whatever you have that looks good. . Use the metal and rubber washers both under your bird bath dish and on top. You'll see why in a minute.. If you're using glue add it to the bird bath dish before you put it on top of the dish below it. Follow the directions on the glue. If I'm using glue I will often wait a day or so for the glue to set up before I move my creation again.. The topper not only looks pretty on top of the bird bath glass, it also covers the washers, lets me add a snug washer and a solar light.. Your topper will need to have a hole drilled into it if you've chosen something like I did, with a votive candle place. On top of your threaded rod, after you've placed your drilled topper, place a metal washer and a rubber washer. . If you chose something big like a pretty glass lid as your topper you will need to add your washers and a 1/4"" nut finger tightened on top of the bird bath piece. Follow the instructions in the next step to cut the threaded rod.. Using your wonderful Dremel set up with the EZ Lock adapter and a Dremel Metal Cutting Wheel cut off the excess threaded rod. . First, put on your safety glasses, long sleeved shirt and gloves. This will send sparks flying all over the place and they sting if they get your arm or hand.. I couldn't cut off my rod inside the candle holder so I marked where to cut on the rod, removed it from the bird bath and then cut it off. After that I replaced the cut down rod through all the pieces, including the washers. . Make sure you have a nut attached to the part that remains before you cut the rod off because you won't be able to thread it on afterward. . Then finger tighten a 1/4"" nut onto the rod and snug it down with the pliers. Don't put any muscle into it or you'll crack your glass. Just make it snug.. Remove the long metal sleeve from the clear plastic housing. Just twist and remove.. Remove the clear plastic ""globe"" from the light holder by twisting slightly and pulling of... Place the plastic ""globe"" in your top piece. Mine was a little taller than I wanted so I needed to cut down the clear plastic piece. . Mark the plastic where you want it cut off. . Pull out your Dremel with the EZ Lock Adaptor and a Wheel for cutting plastic. Put on your safety mask or safety glasses and slice the excess plastic off. . You can glue the clear plastic into place if you want. I chose not to because I think it will be easier to clean my glass pieces if they're not glued down. Just place the clear plastic piece, attached to the bulb and solar collector, into the well on back of the bird - where the votive would normally be placed. . . Pull out the orange tab when you're ready to use the bird bath. I hope to sell mine so I'll wait so the buyer gets a fresh solar light.. Time to repeat the disclaimer. I received NO compensation from Dremel for making this Instructable. I own the Dremel used in this lesson and use it often. I find it the most versatile tool I have. Again, I received NO compensation or recognition writing this lesson from Dremel. I plan to enter this Instructable in a contest and possibly win a new Dremel but that hasn't happened now.. I've made many Bird Baths. Some use lamp bases. Others use various glass pieces like bowls, plates, vases, glasses and candle sconces. It's fun to build a tower of various glass pieces then anchor them with a wide, heavy glass light fixture, microwave plate, or bowl to keep them from tipping over. Drill through the pieces and insert a threaded rod and anchor with nuts and washers. Or glue each piece to the next. Or do both to ensure your creation stays together. Next Instructable  I'll show you how to make a bird bath tower of all glass pieces. . Thanks for viewing my lesson. Now go out there and create some beautiful Bird Baths.

                . If your base is glass the answer is no. If it's something like the metal lamp base I used the answer is ""I don't know. Mine have never stayed around long enough for me too see how they age. Mod Podge or a spray of clear paint would probably work to protect it but be sure to do both inside and outside..

" A fancy decorative birdhouse, made for indoor display or outdoor use. Design is based off of the famous Habitat 67. Habitat 67 photo credit https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9... I designed the file using AutoCAD to create a DXF file for laser cutting. Using a series of cutouts and extensions, similar to finger jointing for a stronger assembly. . Tools and Materials:. Computer and AutoCAD. Laser Cutter or access to laser cutting services. Plywood. Plexiglas. Stain. Polyurethane. Wood Glue. Plexiglas Adhesive. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. I used two sheets of 12""x24"" craft plywood 1/8"" thick. Sanded and stained them with Minwax Golden Oak.. Smoothed the finished stain with fine steel wool. . Created a laser cut file for the wood and Plexiglas.. Laser Cut the Wood and Plexi.. Smoothed the edges with fine sandpaper and coated with Polyurethane. . First assemble the Plexiglas pieces using the Plexiglas adhesive. . Coat the edges of both pieces let stand for 30 seconds before attaching. . After holding the pieces together for two minutes apply an additional bead along the edge. The adhesive will fall into and fill the cracks. . Assembly all sides of the Plexi and let stand. . Lay out the wood pieces for assembly after they have thoroughly dried from the Poly. . Use the wood glue, apply a light layer on the inside edges of the grooves before assembly. . I used a Q-tip to apply the light layer as seen in the photographs. . To begin I laid the back side of the birdhouse face down and glued the sides to it, one by one. . As seen in the photographs the pieces fit within one another using the grooves.. I used the wood glue and assembled each piece individually until all the sides were installed.. Lastly for the wood assembly, lay a light layer of glue on all the edges (facing up) already installed. . Install the front face of the birdhouse.. Let the wood assembly dry over night. . The last step is to attach the Plexiglas and Wood to one another. . The Plexiglas contains three L shaped connectors on each side.. These slide into the six holes on the front face of the birdhouse, and down to lock into place.. The last piece is the ""key"" also made of Plexi it is 1/4"" wider than the pool and contains two small teeth.. After sliding the pool down, two small 1/8"" square holes are exposed above the pool from where the L connectors slid in. The key slides into this gap, fills the holes, and keeps the pool from being able to rise. . The clear Plexi is able to hold water if used outside, a source of drinking water or bird bath. . The front edge is 1/2"" shorter than the sides to allow the overflow during rain. . Participated in the Summer Fun Contest 2016. Participated in the Outside Contest 2016.

" If you go on you tube and search for hummingbird bath, you can find a video of humming birds playing in a shallow pan of water with fresh water being circulated by a small pump. Try https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vsXFH0YbZE Not my work but has made Wifey dear want one so she could watch the little birds skim the water and occasionally stop for a real bath. However, she didn't want a power cord stretched out the window so it needed to be solar powered.. I found a small solar powered fountain pump at harbor freight. The same model can be found on amazon and home depot. It only has about a 9 inch lift and that is probably in very bright sun. All I needed is two to three inches of lift so this is sufficient. The model has a solar panel with 16 feet of cord so the solar panel could go on the roof with the bird bath on the ground. The output of the panel is stated to be 1.5 watts at 7 votes. I expect it could be replaced with a small 6 vote lead acid if that was necessary. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. The bird bath consists of two baking pans. A deep one to act as a water reservoir and a shallow one to act as the bird path. I added the solar powered fountain pump, a couple of washers, some 1/2 in outer diameter, 3/8 in inner diameter hose and some hose clamps. Due to the deep pan not being deep enough, I used extra hose to lift the shallow pan up a bit. This was attached with some sealant. Hopefully, the sealant will conform to the edge of the pan and stick. The nonstick coating on the shallow pan was giving me some problems. I may replace it with some self adhesive gasket. The adhesive should stick to the deep pan rim without too much trouble. . The shallow pan fits inside the deep pan and the handles keep it from falling in. Unfortunately the deep pan needed to be a little deeper as the pump was a little higher than I thought. To fix this I glued some of the hose to the bottom of the shallow pan and you will see the tape holding it in place in some of the pictures. Getting a deeper bottom pan would probably be better but wifey dear wanted it today. . Using a 1/2 inch drill I drilled a hole in the handle of the shallow pan. Feeding some of the hose through the hole from the upper side I put the pump adapter on the hose and tightened it down with a hose clamp. The hole was a little tight so the pump is likely going to be lifted with the upper pan when removed for cleaning.. Wifey dear acted as the hand model. . Stretch the hose to the other side of the pan and cut it off about 6 inches past the other side. Drill another 1/2 in hole through the bottom of the pan on that side near the edge. When the hose is pushed through this hole it will essentially be contained by the friction fit of the holes. Double the hose over and tighten a hose clamp over it to close off the end.. To drain the water back into the lower pan, drill a hole in the shallow pan opposite the opening for the pump. Using some sealant, glue two washers over the hole. The thickness of the washers will determine how deep the water will be, assuming the pan is level. . Drill some holes in the hose pointed slightly downwards. Be conservative as you don't want to blast the little birds out of the pan or lose all the water. . Place the deep pan on a surface, fill with water and put the shallow pan on top. You can see I will need to level the surface a bit but having a slight tip may be beneficial to the birds. Just make sure the water will drain back into the lower pan and not out the side. . When you get enough sun the pump will spray some water out the holes in the hose.I was able to get a couple of photos of the action. One around 1pm and another around 6pm. Both show a couple of sprays and some dripping. . Once it is leveled up and running, some decoration can be added to make it prettier. Maybe the bottom pan can be painted and some plants or moss added.. Participated in the Summer Fun Contest 2016. Participated in the Renewable Energy Contest.

" The other day I came across a video on the internet of a hummingbird feeding bar. I immediately thought that was a clever idea. Upon searching for hummingbird bar, I came across these nifty ones from Perky-Pet: http://www.birdfeeders.com/perky-pet-hummerbar-hum...Their feeders cost $19.99 and $29.99. Cool looking, but too expensive. I decided to make my own and I am very happy with the results. This Instructables explains how I made my 2 x 24"" feeding bars (but you may choose to make 1 x 48"" bar instead) for ONLY $12.60.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Materials:- 4 ft. Fluorescent Tube Protector ($3.47). - Epoxy putty ($5.77). - 4 x 15/16"" (#212) Screw Eyes ($1.18 for 8). - Red Nail Polish ($1.00). - 2 x Small S hooks ($1.18). - String (free). - Cork (free). Total Cost: $12.60. Tools:- Rotary tool with cut-off wheel or Hack Saw. - Wide boxing tape or Saran Wrap. - Drill. - Level. - Hole Saw . - Old soldering iron (optional). - Sharpie pen. The tube protector comes with black stoppers on each end.Tape the holes of those stoppers from the outside, then epoxy the inside. Let it set then wash the inside really well a couple of times. . NOTE: Since each tube protector comes with 2 stoppers, you will not be able to use the 2 x 24"" tubes simultaneously unless you procure 2 extra stoppers. I am alternating my tubes. . This is the most intricate part of the whole project.Fill the tube with water almost to the top. Cap it and lay it flat on a level surface. Leave enough air inside for the buble to spread all the way across the tube. The water level will be used to determine where the flower holes will be drilled. . Stabilize the tube so it won't roll. Looking from the side, the water level should be 4/5 of the way up the tube. The 2 flower rows should be about 1"" apart (measured on top following the contour of the tube). Adjust the volume of water inside if needed. . Find the top center of the tube (the equal distance between the ends of the tube and the rows of flowers) and mark an X with a Sharpie pen. That spot will be where you fill the tube. . Mark the mid point of the water line on both rows of flowers with dots. Starting on the water line dots you just created, measure every 1.5 inches on each direction on both sides.. Once both rows are dotted, roll the tube to align the top center X to the water line. Measure 1"" from each end of the tube and mark that spot on the water line. Those marks will be where you hang your feeder from. . Now that you have a tube with 2 rows of leveled dots about 1.5"" apart and X markings on the top center and ends of the tube, it is time to start creating the holes. . I created my feeding holes using an old soldering iron (easier) but you can achieve the same result using a drill. The holes should be around size 3/32. Make holes on each dot you created. For 24"" tubes, that will be 24 feeding holes. . NOTE: Skip the center dots and end dots of both rows.. Using a hole saw roughly the same diameter as the cork, make a hole where the top center X is. The cork should fit snug but does not need to seal. The only purpose of the cork is to keep animals out of your sugar water. . Using a small drill bit, make pilot holes where the top end marks are. Screw in a screw eye on each side. Make sure each side goes in roughly the same depth into the tube. Using the epoxy putty, cover the point of the screw inside the tube. That will make it safer for cleaning and prevent the screw to rust. . Paint each feeding hole with a red flower using the nail polish. The easiest way I found to do this is to make an asterisk using the hole as the center. You may need to do 2 or 3 coats of nail polish until the color is a vibrant red. NOTE: There are other ways of doing this... red stickers, red wire connectors, etc. The key here is durability, easiness to clean, and the color RED!. Next step is to hang your feeder. It needs to be as level as possible. Use the level to accomplish that. I hung mine with screw eyes attached to the ceiling. The screws are about 26 inches apart. That helps to stabilize the back and forth movement of the bar in case of strong winds. I used fishing line to dangle the bar to about 6.5 feet high. S hooks make it easier to hang and remove the feeder for cleaning (every 3 days or so around here... it varies with the ambient temperature. Warmer climates require more frequent cleaning). Use a bottle brush to clean the inside of the feeder.Once your feeding bar is hung, add your HOMEMADE ""nectar"" through the filling hole. A funnel makes that task easier. Cork the filling hole. NECTAR RECIPE: 1 part white granulated cane sugar dissolved in 4 parts of drinking water. Mix the 2 ingredients then heat it up to a rolling boil. Remove from heat and let it cool completely before adding to the feeder. IMPORTANT: Do not use the ready to use red nectar sold in stores. Do not add food coloring to your homemade nectar. . .

"This instructable is how to build a bird feeder from a used tin can and twine. I built this for my mom for her birthday and she absolutely loved it. I works phenomenally and the birds seem to love the twine perch to stand on. To my surprise, you really cant tell it's actually a tin can until you get really quite close, and the twine serves as a great contrast to the metal. This is a design that is versatile enough to fit in any location, and you can change the wrapping material on the outside to make it fit any style.. Materials consist of:. - Tin Can. - Jute Twine. - Scissors. - Razor Knife. - Can opener. - Large Popcicle Stick/ Tongue Depressor. - Hot Glue. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson..      First you have to prepare the can by removing the labels and using the can opener to cut around half of the lid. Then fold the loose lid back in the can. Make sure to not leave any sharp edges around the rim which might injure or cut the birds in some way. This is why you should not cut off the other half of the lid, and rather fold it, because if it is cut, it exposes a sharp edge which could cause injury to the birds while they eat. .      In this step it you need to pick which size of can to use because that will determine some design choices later on. I think it would look really cool to build around 5 or more of all different sizes, and hang them scattered around in a small tree. The rustic twine and the reflections and modern appeal of the tin can would really go nice together, especially on a large scale design..      In this step you have to wrap the can with your twine. You can use thin twine like I used or use twine up to half an inch and have it mimic rope you might find on a dock. This step is where you can determine the overall design and anything from a quaint bird feeder in a rural area, to a rustic style bird feeder near the beach. .      I used hot glue to tack it down in the middle of the bottom of the can, and started my wrap there. On the bottom side I had to glue it down in multiple spots each spin, but once I got over to the sides, I was able to tack it down about every 5 turns. Make sure to wrap the twine around the base really tight because the bird feeder will be out in the elements. .      After about and inch or so of wraps around the side, make sure to glue your popsicle stick down as a perch for the birds, and wrap around that as well. When I got the the very end of my can, I entirely glued the string down for the last few wraps, and then continued to wrap around the popsicle stick on the bottom. I glued the end of the twine to the tip of the popsicle stick, and added a small length of twine to hang it with..       At this point all you need is to fill it with bird seed and hang it up in your back yard or garden. The birds love it, and even though there is only one perch, the same amount of birds still hang around it. It is a great replacement for our old feeder, and it surely looks a lot better. Another added bonus is it is squirrel proof, and nearly impossible for them to land on the small perch..       This is my first instructable, so thank you very much for viewing it! This is a great project to do over the summer with your kids, and you can teach them about birds, wildlife, and nature. I hope you can use it and make one of your own! .         - Brandon, 16 (Modern Rustic Workshop). Runner Up in the Animals in the Wild Challenge. Participated in the Trash to Treasure Challenge.

" This Instructable will show you how to make an easy and inexpensive bird feeder from materials laying around the house. The tea cup and saucer we got for free from a CraigsList curb alert. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Tea cup and saucer. Velcro. E600 (or another strong epoxy/adhesive, OR hot glue with epoxy for added support--something non-toxic). Bird seeds. Before you glue anything down, decide how you want your bird feeder to be set up. We've learned with our own bird, Cecil, that birds won't really dig for seeds, so an upright cup probably won't attract many birds. An easy to peck through layer of seeds, will. . When you've decided on the placement of the cup, use hot glue and/or a strong non-toxic epoxy to cement the pieces in place. Make sure to follow the manufacturer suggestions on how to use exactly. Also make sure to clean up any glue strands etc. so the birds don't accidentally ingest it. . We decided to use velcro to secure the bird feeder because our balcony is a bit oddly put together. Just slap a strip of extra strong velcro to the bottom of your saucer and the other end to where you want your bird feeder to stay and you're good to go. . The bird feeder is going on the window away from our container plants as we've had problems with bird seeds being knocked into the containers and sprouting. . Your local pet and hardware stores will have a variety of seeds, usually ones specific to the birds in your area. We have a mix of wild bird and song bird seeds. . Now that your bird feeder is all set up, sit back and wait for the birds to come. We've been very lucky this summer and have had a wide variety of birds coming to our balcony---we think partially because of the seeds, but also because of our own bird, Cecil. .

" I got the idea of making a bird feeder from the fact that in our area are various birds and this way it is easier to watch them.. It is self-dosing because you can fill the bottle with seeds and turn it upside down and the seeds will flow only when the flower pot saucer will start to get empty.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Materials: . Tools:. First of all, You have to cut down the bottom of the bottle. Thereafter, assemble 2 pieces of wood, I used 3 nails, but You can use screws. This two will be the bottom and the back of the feeder.To attach the bottle, I drilled two holes in the back of the feeder and I placed into 1-1 screw with 1-1 nut and screw washer. Between the nuts and the screw washer I attached the builders tape. This tape will hold the bottle.After placing the bottle (upside down) in the bottle's holder, I made a 'roof' to protect from the rain, for that I used the 3. piece of wood.Finally, I put the flower pot saucer under the bottle, and I filled the bottle up with seeds. . I put the bottom of the bottle into the bottle to avoid birds flying into it - optional.. I found a tall tree at the end of the yard what I think this is the best place for birds feeding.I placed a screw in the upper part of the back (above the roof) for the wire, that I used to wrap around the feeder and the tree..

" This project is not an act of cruelty, but helping/ forcing invasive slugs into the food chain! . In Denmark, where I live, the slugs have invaded the gardens. Not more than 5 years ago, there were hardly any slugs in our garden, but they have come from other countries and keep on laying eggs. They have no natural enemies here and therefore there are now thousands of them in our garden! They are gross, and they eat our vegetables and flowers. When we collected them for this project, ALL of the slugs you see in this picture, were literally found in about 2 m^2 of our garden in about 5 minutes. Gross! . However: Birds, hedgehogs and other animals can eat them! They just don't know, because it is so recently that the slugs have come here. So this is the plan: To teach the birds and hedgehogs to eat them. . What you need: . How it works: Slugs can't swim, and birds and hedgehogs need water. So every time you find a slug, place it on the brick island, and it won't be able to escape! Then when the birds and hedgehogs come to get a drink, they will notice the slugs. And eventually, they will eat them! Once they find out that they can eat them, they will automatically start looking for them other places in your garden! So basically, this is not a cruel way to get rid of your slugs, but a way to help/ force them into the food chain. A lot of people use poison or salt to kill their slugs, but using this method, you are feeding birds and hedgehogs instead, with the same results! . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Even though this is a slug killer, we don't want them to suffer. Therefore you must place the birdbath in a shady place, so they don't dry out in the sun. . Also, as you place the slugs on the brick, make sure that you don't accidentally push them into the water - again, we don't want to make them suffer by drowning. . Place the brick in the middle of the birdbath. Make sure that the brick doesn't touch the birdbaths edges, so the slugs can't escape. Now fill it up with water! Put just about 3 - 5 cm (1,1 - 2 inches) water in the birdbath, no more. This is because we don't want hedgehogs to drown. The poor bastards aren't that smart ;) . Snails are harmless, so please don't put them on your island. These small fellas are just chilling out in your garden, and you don't want to hurt them. It is only the invasive slugs we want to keep down! . As I said before, there are A LOT of slugs in our garden! . ALL of the slugs on these pictures, were found approximately inside the red line I drew on the picture, in about 5 minutes! It is completely out of hand... . Just use a trowel to pick up the slugs and place them onto the brick island, but be careful not to harm them. . Like I said before: This project is not an act of cruelty, but helping/ forcing invasive slugs into the food chain! . Now all you have to do, is to wait. It probably wont work the first day, but in about a week, it should be starting to work! . Now all you have to do, is to look out for slugs to place on the island, so that there are always a bunch on the brick. If you do this once daily, it should be enough! . Good luck with your invasive slugs, I hope this will work for you, as it is for me and my mother! :) . Runner Up in the Animals in the Wild Challenge. Participated in the Outside Contest 2016. "
" Hi. Welcome to my birdhouse. This is my first own building project and I'm not a native speaker so please excuse any misspelling. Have fun.. Tubebird. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. First you need wood. Much wood. I used this wooden board. Then I sawed the wooden board in little parts. Two with 40cm x 12 cm and two with 13cm x 12cm. Then I filed the corners with sandpaper. . On the bottom line of one of the long boards I drilled three holes size 3. The edge of the second board was attached to this using some old screws. . Next I drill a hole in the first side and in the other side only a pit. I have to widen the pit. Next I took a rocket stick and put it through the hole.. Now I saw the next board with 46cm x 12cm. On the bottom side I drilled five holes. Second I hold the plank aslope and fix it with screws. Before this I already sawed too small boards so I have to fix it in two part, but it`s aslope again for keep away the rain. . Finaly I used foil to make the house rain save. With a tacker I attached it to the wood. Next I cut the overlaying foil.. Now just put the apples on the stick and wait for the birds. You should drill the apples before sticking them.. I hope you enjoyed my instructable. Questions and comments are welcome and please vote for me cause I want a T-shirt. 8-). Thanks Tubebird.      ;). Participated in the Outdoor Structures Contest.

" My favourite memory from fourth grade was a day that my class went to a nature reserve. The conservationists told me to grab some birdseed and hold it out in front of myself. All of a sudden, a bird landed in my hand and proceeded to eat some of my seeds. I was very surprised because at that point in my life I had never been so close to a bird before. Looking at them up close, they're very exotic and interesting animals, but as quickly as it came, it was gone. And I was hooked.. . Sadly every year, birds are ingesting the plastic that we humans deposit into their habitats. The birds regularly confuse these plastics for food and eat it. They also feed this plastic to their chicks. This project aims to help out the birds a little. Rather than allowing plastics to find themselves in landfills, we are going to make a recycled plastic bird feeder.. . My design is great for people without a lot of tools and/or skills. This is also a great home-school project for kids to do. Kids enjoy feeding the birds (which you can learn to do at the end). This is also a great way for them to learn some environmental stewardship.. Let's get started!. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. For this project you will need:. For this step, you will only need your smaller drill bit:. Drill four or five holes in parallel lines as shown in the picture in red. . Attach your larger bit to your drill and drill the two holes marked once again in red. Make sure that the holes are pretty much opposite to each other. These will be the holes for hanging your feeder. . Drill a hole at the end of both sticks. Drill a couple more holes along the center. While doing this be careful not to snap the popsicle stick in half. Try to only drill about five holes per stick.. You may be wondering why you have been drilling so many holes in odd places. Wonder no longer! These holes are for a technique that I call glue-filling. . The steps of how to glue-fill are as follows:. Glue-filling will help the glue permanently hold parts together. You will not be just utilizing the adhesion of the glue but the hardness of it as well. On my first feeder, I didn't glue-fill and after a couple of days, it broke.. Glue-fill all of the small holes in the lid. Try to join the fill for extra strength as shown in the picture. . Glue-fill the popsicle stick holes. . Put some fresh hot-glue over the glue-fill to glue the lid to the popsicle sticks. The sections of glue-fill should be touching. Try to move the popsicles sticks so they are parallel and centred on the lid.. This part is a little complicated so I broke it up into more manageable parts:. With your small drill bit again drill five holes it the bottom of your lid. These will let rainwater escape from the seed basin to prevent mold.. Even more glue-filling, I hope that you aren't bored of it yet. This will the last time, I promise. This time you will need to be careful of some things though:. Now for the moment you have all been waiting for! This part you only get one chance at so double-check everything before you move on. Look back at the picture a couple of times as this will help with the positioning.. Does everything look good? Great, follow these steps:. Put some glue on top of where filling it on the container. Now, align the fill in the cap to the container's fill and press down to glue them together.. To make the feeder hang better, tie an overhand loop in the center of the string. This also makes the feeder look nicer.. The whole purpose of this feeder was to hold food, right? I personally like to use black oil sunflower seeds, so my design (this one) works with those. You should be able to use any kind of seed, theoretically. Please let me know what kind you use in the comments. . I fill about 1/3 of the container before hanging it the first time, just in case it falls down for whatever reason. This will fill to almost the top with no problems, so really it is up to you how much to put in.. You will need to flip the feeder over right before you hang it, otherwise, it is probably better to leave it upside down.. When you do need to flip it follow these steps:. Before you hang your feeder, you should probably think about where it will go. Birds enjoy the security of being near a tree or tall bush to quickly hide from predators. Another thing to think about while hanging it is squirrels. Where I live they are a big problem. As an attempt to deter squirrels I  give my feeders a sphere of at least 2.5m(8ft) in diameter of clear space. this way squirrels can't leap onto my feeders from other branches or the ground. I also like to put my feeders in places that I will see from inside of my house. . To hang your feeder, you will need to:. Once you have birds coming to your feeder often, (which shouldn't take long depending on where you live) you will be able to hand-feed birds. This is an amazing thing to do with kids and is a very rewarding and fun activity. What are you waiting for?. I hope that you have enjoyed the process of creating your own recycled bird feeder. I also hope that this has brightened up your isolation period as much as it did mine. If you have any suggestions to improve my design, that would be awesome! . If you liked this project and want to show your appreciation, voting me in the trash to treasure contest would really help me out. Thanks!. Participated in the Trash to Treasure Contest. "
" How to upcycle  a coffee can into a chic birdhouse.  . Easy to make with hand tools and a few dollars in materials.. The most expensive part is probably the coffee that was originally in the can.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. These plans are adjustable to based on the coffee can you have.  I used a standard 10 oz foil can.. You need the energy and you need to empty the coffee can anyways.. I made my birdhouse out of rough cedar that I purchased at Menards.. Any big box store would have similar materials.. You will need the following:. This project is easily completed with hand tools.  Power tools make things faster but not always safer if you are doing this with a little helper.Tools needed:. Cut your boards to the sizes shown above.. You will need two pieces 4-1/4"" x 4-1/4"" square for the end panels.. Since our boards were 5-1/2"" wide, this will be the width of the widest roof panel.  . The other one will be cut to 4-3/4"" to give us a 1/2"" roof overhang.. The length of the roof panels is adjustable based on the size of your coffee can.. Measure your coffee can then add 1-1/2"" for each end or 3"" total to the length of the roof panels.. After cutting, you might want to hit all the edges with some sandpaper to avoid nasty splinters.. Measure in 1-1/2"" from each end of the roof panels to mark where the end panels will be.  . This will aid in assembly and nailing the birdhouse together later.. Use a rule and a square to mark your lines. . I know this is a birdhouse, but you can practice good layout skills even on a birdhouse. Use the narrow roof panel to layout where the glue and nails will go on the wider panel.. Pre-drill the nail holes with a 1/8"" twist drill.  This is not necessary, but this will keep wood from splitting.. In this photo, you can see where I marked the layout for the end panels.. Glue and nail the roof together.. I used three nails here.. Here you can see how things will go together.  . Notice the roof is now symmetrical and there is an even overhang on both sides.. This was designed as a wren house.. Draw an X from corner to corner and mark the center for the hole.. Use a 1-1/8"" spade bit to drill a through hole in one end panel.. If you want to make this for another type of bird, you will need to research what size hole you need.. Do not make the hole too large or you will get pests (eg. sparrows) living in you birdhouse.. Make sure your measurements and layout are still correct.. This is the last time to make adjustments.. Apply a bit of glue and assemble the end panels.. Use your layout lines to help you get these in the right place.. Pre-drill four nail holes (2 each side of roof) and assemble with 6d galvanized finish nails.. Take your time and check your alignment as you go.. Offset the nails slightly to avoid hitting another nail.. Use a few clamps or a helper if you need to while assembling the birdhouse.. Sometimes the parts like to move around too much while nailing.. Sometimes the nails will have a mind of their own.. This happens even when you are trying to be careful.. Take your time and tap or pull the nails out and try again.. I goofed on my layout lines.  I just moved the nail holes over a bit and re-nailed things together.. The birds will never know the difference.. Maybe you can offer to discount the rent.. Use a 1/4"" dowel rod to hold the coffee can and the wood together.. Layout and drill a hole for dowel. I placed mine about 1/2"" in from the corner.. I ended up using a 9/32"" drill bit.  The 1/4"" hole was too tight.. You will want the dowel to be secure, but you also need to able to remove it for cleaning and maintenance.. Drill a hole in both end panels.. Most people think a birdhouse needs a perch.. Have you ever seen a tree with a perch?. Birds will know how to get in and out of the birdhouse.. Sometimes the perch makes it too easy for predators to get to the eggs.. Trim it flush with the front of the house.. . I twisted two screw eyes about 1"" in from each end of the roof.. Pre-drilling will make this easier, but this is not necessary.. Use a pair of pliers or a nail to help screw these into the wood.. When the eyes are in, you are done!. Go outside and look for great places to hang your new birdhouse.. Congratulations on your project.. These are the screw eyes I used.. This pack cost me about $1.25 at Menards.. If you wanted to make this house last longer, I would use stainless steel hardware.. Here is another birdhouse I made using plastic canister from another brand of coffee.. Adjust the length of your roof panels to accommodate the difference in size of canisters.. "

Their sizes and shapes depends on birds which are ment to live in them. Do some research what birds are in Your area.Then search for a good house sizes on the internet.. In my case, I chose house for sparrow, so my dimensions are: Entrance - 33mm  Height - 240mm Depth - 110mm. Remember: Distance between bottom and the entrance can not be to short to avoid predators (ie. cats). Do some cuttings. In fact You will only need just:- two same sizes sides - one front - one back - the roof. I recommend to cut first the rear, than the front and then You will know how cut the sides and the bottom. The roof should be about 2' (5cm) longer than whole birdhouseMake the hole for an entrance (use drill, or thin saw, or eaven carving, sharp knife). Make small drill holes in front and rear desks to avoid wood splitting. Now connect those parts with the sides with screws. That's all!. Bird's doesn't mind if they live in painted or not painted home, buyt You do. Painted birdhouses could be very decorative and could give something new to Your garden. That's all.

"When the 3.5mm audio is plugged in, it disconnects internal speaker. This project takes control of the behavior of the speaker.. Read up about this project on . When the 3.5mm audio is plugged in, it disconnects internal speaker. This project takes control of the behavior of the speaker.. WARNING! DO AT YOUR OWN PERIL, THIS WILL DEFINITELY VOID THE WARRANTY FOR THE ECHO DOT AND MIGHT BRICK THE DEVICE. On the other hand your loss is limited to $30, that's what Amazon is charging now for the device, and you are working with low currents, so no electric shock risk :-). I did brick the Echo, so do what I say but don't do what I do :-) Nevertheless, got a new one and completed the project, now being more careful with soldering (must have shorted something previously). See the video below. At the end I added the description of the solution as well (with the code). At $30 the Echo Dot is a steal as a music streamer, as it has an 3.5mm audio jack (as well as Bluetooth, if that's what you prefer). The internal speaker is good for only command-response stuff, I wouldn't self-inflict listening music on it. The challenge is that when the 3.5mm jack is plugged in it silences the internal speaker; unless you have an always-on amplifier you'd end up missing Alexa responses. The typical use case in my opinion (and my case) is an amplifier that's used for various inputs (music streaming, record player but could be TV, CD, etc) and that I switch into stand-by when not used. As such there is no guarantee that when you talk to Alexa the amplifier would be both on and connected to the right input; with the internal speaker silenced always when the 3.5mm plugged in it is a lottery to hear the responses.. The Echo Dot is using a 3.5mm connector that disconnects two pair of pins when the jack plugged in. The solution is relatively simple: run cables to those pin pairs and decide when to activate the internal speaker. There are various options that can be pursued, depending on your configuration and sophistication:. Taking apart the Dot is actually not that difficult. But things will never be the same again afterwards; there is a sticky rubber pad that you can put back but it will show has been removed (though this is at the bottom of the device so not visible at all). Also, there is some drilling, soldering, cutting involved. And as I warned at the beginning, this involves working with delicate electronics, so you always risk to brick the device. Now that you have been warned.... Gently remove the rubber pad at the bottom. Pry it delicately and it will peel off.. Once the rubber mat removed there is still a transparent foil glued to the bottom. In order to access the screws I simply drilled holes through that foil. Using a Torx screwdriver, remove the screws. Delicately open the device.. Now comes the tricky part. The pins for the 3.5mm connector are very small so be very careful. The cables need to be soldered to the the pins marked 1-4 in the photo above. If you short pins 1&2 and 3&4, the internal speaker will be on, even if a 3.5mm jack is plugged in. As I described in the ""My Solution"" section, there are various options how and when to turn on/off the internal speaker.. Same view with the cables soldered.. In order to get the cables out there are few modifications that are necessary.. Firstly, the internal skeleton is of something that looks like a magnesium alloy (BTW quite remarkable for a device at this price point). It is necessary to remove a little underneath where the connector sits to let the cables out. I used a Dremel but whatever works.. Next there is a need to cut on opening in the plastic enclosure to let the cables out.. Just to make sure the cable stays firmly I put a little glue, and an isolation on top. Eventually, assemble it altogether. I'm using a Sunfounder 2 Channel 5V relay. . Connected as follows (relay -> Photon), please note that the jumper RY-VCC/VCC MUST be removed in this configuration:. Then with Alexa connect what I marked as 1&2 to J1 1&2 and 3&4 to J2 1&2 (these are normally closed, so even if power down, the internal speaker would be active).. I'm not documenting here the Photon part, is part of a serial controller described here https://www.hackster.io/saka/automate-bluesound-s-node-with-amplifier-and-alexa-control-3fbc9e.. Additionally, I'm using the amplifier 12V trigger. This ensures that when e.g. the amplifier is switched off manually, it resets Alexa to the internal speaker.. . . . "

I think this project meets this goal and I will now guide you through the steps of building your own Hunter Flatterer Robot. So let us start with a system diagram that shows all the parts of the robot and how they plug together. We will be referencing this throughout the build and checking it off as we go along.. Don't be too daunted by this diagram if you have never used motors before. It basically boils down to Four main parts:. The next four sections will mirror this list and guide you through setting up each part.. So you've got yourself a battery, what next?. The above diagram shows how to connect up all the components for power, if you follow the wiring in the schematic this is the real life representation. . I could explain this, but it's better to just follow the tutorial I did: http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Modules-L298N-Dual-H-Bridge-Motor-Controll.. So now you've wired everything up, you have blue lights flashing everywhere and no blue smoke so you're good to go. Let's get on to making this bad boy work.. When I designed this I decided I wanted two things to happen, it look cool & it shows off the Ci20 as well as possible. I mean this is the point of the competition right?. I designed this robot to be completely 3D printable and the designs are all available below. Basically at this point go and print yourself the top, bottom & wheels. If you don't have access to a 3D Printer you can check out www.3dhubs.com to get someone to print it for you! You can check out the designs below. Here's a pretty render I did of the design to make sure that the ci20 was going to fit and be in pride of place. Once you've got it all printed you can glue all the parts in as above (or use masking tape if you're not feeling two confident. You will need an M4 bolt to hold in the motors.. The CI20 is the boss, the brains of the operation. Without it the robot will flounder. So what does it do?. Well the ci20 is going to use OpenCV to detect your face and then send appropriate commands over serial to the Arduino to get the motors going in the right direction.. Step 1: Install OpenCV. Like I've said throughout this guide, I wasn't trying to reinvent the apple-cart. I'm trying to build something that you can do at home and extend on with relative ease. So to install OpenCV go and follow this tutorial:. It talks you through step-by-step of getting OpenCV up and running.. Step 2: Run the code. The Face Tracking code will need compiling and running, run this command on the file on the Ci20.. The binary file to be created: FaceTracking: main.cpp > Source file: FaceTracking.cpp. Easy right?. After flashing the Arduino with the code in the attachments below. Plug the Arduino into the USB port on the CI20 and run your recently created FaceTracker. You will see a camera feed pop up (Oh yeah, plug in the webcam) and if you stick your face in the middle the wheels on the robot should start making it drive forward!. Now due to time constraints I didn't quite get it to do anything else, so here's a challenge for anyone that has got this far. There are two things you can add to make this bot super awesome:. Add a set of speakers and some sound files so that when the face is large enough on the screen it plays a sound file to the person. "
"Portable lighting station synchronized with music, with the Infineon CoolMOS C7 MOSFET.. Read up about this project on . Portable lighting station synchronized with music, with the Infineon CoolMOS C7 MOSFET.. Portable lighting station synchronized with music.. Always use technology to improve the world, if you are a black hat or gray hat hacker please abstain at this point......... or at least leave your respects to make me feel less guilty XP.. Nowadays for an organizer or independent musician, events, reunions and parties may not follow the traditional way of arriving, playing and leaving. Fans today require a higher level of entertainment, which led to organizers having to buy expensive lighting and sound control systems to achieve the level needed for the fans' show.. This type of lighting systems have a complex and expensive system of controls to handle each of the lights, most of the time it is necessary to set up a light show beforehand for each of the songs, increasing even more the costs.. Here are some similar products in the market, which are of very low quality:. None of the products available in the market sell for less than 40 dollars. They only allows the control of low power elements such as LED's, but if we really want to control high power elements we need a circuit that is capable of it without risking the controller, in this case an Arduino. . The purpose of the circuit is to switch from a digital signal of 0-5 V DC to a control signal of 120 V AC.. In the first stage of the circuit we have an Infineon 600VCoolMOS C7 MOSFET, which will allow us to control the optocoupler demanding the minimum current to the Arduino board, because the optocoupler requires at least 5 volts at 36mA to be able to drive. This is very close to the limit of the current that the Arduino board can supply, however the 600VCoolMOS only requires a signal of 5 volts at 60uA, thus showing an excessive improvement in the consumption that it requires from the board.. This consumption is extremely important because it gives us the possibility of being able to literally use any controller to perform this task due to its low consumption, thus not requiring more expensive drivers that can supply said power in their ports.. The MOSFET's operation is to ground the optocoupler diode, once this is activated it allows the flow of energy through the DIAC and this in turn allows the passage of current in the TRIAC connected to the lamp and igniting it in the process.. The other great advantage of using the MOSFET is the ease of increasing the number of drivers as in Image 1 or using more powerful drivers as in Image 2 without changing the design of the main circuit.. Different results in different boards: . Another solution to this project would have been to use relays, which have the function of performing this same task but mechanically, by generating a ""Click"" on each switch. The problem with this type of component is that if we use dimerizable lights or the switching frequency was larger, the relay could not perform this task, which the mosfet, optocoupler and triac can easily do.. For this project it is possible to make individual modules to be able to expand the number of bulbs or high voltage devices connected to the Arduino or to any other board. . You can also make a complete module for 4 AC outputs this in order to integrate the entire system on one PCB, both files are in the ""PBC Files"" folder in the Github or in the footer of the project.. To develop this circuit, we first tested each of the stages were carried out to demonstrate its effectiveness, the first circuit to be tested was the control of the bulbs by means of a button and safety gloves due to high voltage. (Please if you are to replicate the experiment use any safety measures possible, playing with live current is not wise).. For the second circuit since the Lamp control works well, a platform with LEDs was made to see how the Arduino controlled the lights to the rhythm of the music, the code is in the ""Arduino Code"" folder, the code is thoroughly commented.. Once we saw that the lights control worked, we connected all the components of the whole circuit in a protoboard, to control the 4 lights and connected it to the Arduino.. As you can see this was done in steps to manage safety, I repeat it is dangerous managing live 120V AC power so take any precautions into consideration.. With the circuit running, we decided to make control modules like the one shown in the image to not depend on any cable failing in the breadboard.. The board was made based on the one that is in the folder ""PCB Files"" however since we did not have transfer paper we had to make the vias with a sharpie. It is a permanenr marker so when you dip the plate in ferric chloride it survives, this process is the classic one for making homemade PCBs. You can get to know more about this process in the following link:. https://www.hackster.io/Junezriyaz/how-to-make-pcb-using-marker-531087. After making three aditional PCB's, we decided to put the entire circuit in a box, covering it and with 4 identical lamps so that this was a more aesthetic product and easy to transport.. And we are done! With this we have finished the light synchronization system for electrical elements (120 or 220 volts).. This project was carried out in order to demonstrate that the control of lights through microcontrollers can be efficient and cheap, since current systems at a much lower quality are sold at excessive prices and therefore not available to all.. And to showcase a creative and seldom seen approach to use the CoolMOS C7 MOSFETs provided by Infineon. All the information about the technology used, and direct references are in our wiki:.

"MAX86150 puts ECG and SPO2 on a single chip, opening new opportunities for calculation of pulse transit time and indirect blood pressure.. Read up about this project on . MAX86150 puts ECG and SPO2 on a single chip, opening new opportunities for calculation of pulse transit time and indirect blood pressure.. Measuring blood pressure traditionally involves a nurse or the doctor placing an inflatable handcuff to somewhere above your elbow, asking you to breathe in and out. They then use a stethoscope to understand the timing of the measure. If you happen to have one of those digital Blood pressure meters at your home, you already know the poor accuracy.  This is by no means a continuous or consistent measure of blood pressure !. Cuff less BP measurement  has always been a challenge. There are a wide variety of studies where several methods were developed for cuff-free BP measurement and one among them which showed great potential is PTT or Pulse Transit Time, which acts as an indicator of Blood Pressure. Pulse Transit Time in simple words is the time taken by a pulse wave to propagate from heart to the point where reading is taken, in our case the finger tip.. Maxim Integrated recently released the MAX86150, a biopotential sensor which gives both Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) simultaneously sampled.  According to clinical studies, we can measure PTT(Pulse Transmit Time) which is a measure of our blood pressure using ECG and PPG waveforms.. At ProtoCentral, we are passionate about pushing the boundaries of DIY and affordable health. So we made a breakout board of this little sensor, which can be connected to any micro-controller using a simple I2C interface with easy-to-use ECG pads on which you can record ECG from your fingers.. You can plug in this breakout board just like how you plug in I2C devices to an Arduino Uno using jumper wires or use QWIIC connectors for a quick connection !. Arduino connect to  BreakoutBoard. 5V                           VCC. GND                        GND. A4                            SDA. A5                            SCL. You can get our Arduino libraries for the MAX86150 here or you can install it from the Arduino IDE's libraries page. Once installed, check out our examples:. . You can either use the Arduino IDE's built-in serial plotter utility or use something like ProtoCentral OpenView to look at the ECG and PPG waveforms.. This functionality is not currently built into the current version of our Arduino library, but will be in the future. Meanwhile, we used Python to calculate the PTT peak and foot intervals of each segment of ECG-PPG that is measured simultaneously by the MAX86150 breakout board. . Below is quick run through of the code.. . For each R peak detected, we discovered the following trench and peak of the processed PPG signal. The time intervals are obtained using the sampling frequency. . PTT is often inversly proportional to BP. Though there are several limitations of using PTT to measure ecg, this board opens a platform to work on those limitations. . Note: There is still work to be done to accurately calculate PTT intervals, watch this space for updates on this project. . "
"Electroplate conductive materials using an Arduino Uno and a relay.. Read up about this project on . Electroplate conductive materials using an Arduino Uno and a relay.. Electroplating is a process that uses an electric current to reduce dissolved metal cations so that they form a thin coherent metal coating on an electrode.. Reasons for electroplating: . This system will use a bucket with an electrolyte solution made of copper sulfate as well as copper pipe to plate metal objects. . I made my electrolyte solution by mixing copper sulfate and distilled water. The ratio of copper sulfate to water will determine how conductive the electrolyte is, and you should vary this ratio depending on your desired plating speed. The more conductive the solution, the faster the plating process will occur. I'm starting off with a ratio of 1 oz of copper sulfate to 2 cups of distilled water. . Once we have our electrolyte solution, we will need to set up the copper pipe and aquarium pump. I designed some clips in Tinkercad to hold the copper pipe along the side of the bucket and 3D-printed them on my Anet A8. I then inserted a tube from the aquarium pump through the copper pipe to the bottom of the solution. This will help agitate the electrolyte solution during the plating process. I also 3D-printed a mount to suspend the cathode in the center of the bath.. . The Arduino Uno is used along with a relay to toggle the power to electrolyte solution. The Uno will turn on the power for 10 seconds and then leave it off for 1 second. These values can be adjusted in the sketch as desired. . I have a simple button switch to enable/disable the plating process. . . I'm using a 4s lipo battery along with a buck converter to regulate the voltage because I don't have a bench power supply. I plan to test plating at different voltages to see what works best for my setup.. . . I started off by plating some coins. These were done at around 3 volts and were pulling around 600mA during the plating process. I plated each coin for about five to ten minutes and was surprised by how fast they plated.. . It works! But plating coins has been done many times before. So I ordered some conductive paint and started painting some 3D prints.. . First attempt was this wolf ring, which wasn't the best print but worked great as a first test.. The ring wasn't plating as fast as the coins because I didn't apply enough coats of the conductive paint. I plated this ring for about 4 hours. . Then I tried some more 3D prints but this time I applied an excessive amount of paint hoping that it would make the prints more conductive. . The prints are much harder to plate and it seems I still need to test some different settings to fine tune the process. . . . . It looks like I still need to test some different settings on the system but overall I'm very pleased with the results. . I hope you enjoyed this intro to electroplating and encourage you to give it a shot.. I would like to thank Elegoo for sponsoring this project. They sent out their Super Starter Kit which came with everything you need to get started hacking on Arduino projects. I used the following items from the starter kit:  Arduino Uno, prototyping hat, breadboard, relay, resistors, leds, button switch and jumper wires. .

"This is the 2nd tutorial on my ESP32 learning journey. Here, an OLED shows time and captured data by DHT sensor (temperature & humidity).. Read up about this project on . This is the 2nd tutorial on my ESP32 learning journey. Here, an OLED shows time and captured data by DHT sensor (temperature & humidity).. This tutorial is a continuation of a journey to learn more about this great IoT device, the ESP32.. In my last tutorial, IOT Made Simple: Playing With the ESP32 on Arduino IDE, we explored:. Now let's included an OLED to present locally the data captured by DHT sensor (temperature & humidity) as well the local time. . https://media.giphy.com/media/qdxLVaiWGooak/giphy.gif. We will use the Arduino IDE to program our ESP32, same way we do with the ESP8266 family.. Install Drivers:. It is important that you have installed on your computer the updated CP210x USB to UART Driver. Enter in this link: usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers and install the proper driver for your OS.. Install Library:. The novelty here is that Expressif itself in its GitHub will give us the proper directions for library installation: arduino-esp32. Follow the instructions for your OS. . After that, restart Arduino IDE and it's done! You must see several boards in the ""TOOLS"" menu. Select the appropriate for you. In general, the ""generic"" ESP32 DEV MODULE works fine.. We will start from the HW assembled in my last tutorial. We will go faster here, but if want more details, please visit: IOT Made Simple: Playing With the ESP32 on Arduino IDE. In short:. Install the DHT22 as shown (looking the sensor with the ""grid"" face you, count the 4 legs from left to right):. Then:. For testing the DHT, first install the libraries as described in the next step.. First, you need to have the Adafruit Library installed in your IDE. Go to their GitHub and download the updated version of this library: DHT-sensor-library. When I used for the first time I got a message:. After some digging, I found that it is also necessary to have the Adafruit Unified Sensor Library also installed. So, I did it from Arduino IDE Library Manager (see picture above). After that, everything worked fine, same as we use to do with Arduino and NodeMCU.. Let's do some tests with this sensor.  You can use the ""DHT tester.ino"" example sketch that it is included in the library, or do your own.. I wrote a simple code for test the sensor that can be downloaded from my GitHub: ESP32_DHT. For this tutorial, I will use a 128 x 32 I2C OLED display. In principle, once you have the library installed, the ESP32 would also work with a 128 x 64 OLED display. Once this device is a I2C display, you will need to connect 4 pins with the ESP32:. Now, install the library. We will use here the Daniel Eighhoen version. Open the library manager and search for ""OLED"". See the above picture. I have the 3.2.7 version installed.. Open SSD1306SimpleDemo in Examples Menu and replace the code:. with:. Below a GIF showing the Simple Demos partially working. Note that this demo was designed for a 128 x 64 display, so you realize that in my case, where I used 128 x 32, the graphics are shrunk.. https://media.giphy.com/media/key4A8EOkHKzC/giphy.gif . You can easily create and install new fonts on your display. I created a new font that can give me around 2 lines of 20 characters each on the 128 X 32 OLED display.. How to create it:. Go to SSD1306 Font Converter, a great tool also developed by Daniel Eighhoen. There, you must choose:. Press Create and voilá!  A ""C Font"" file is created in the proper window. . The above photo shows a new ""Hello World"", using this new font. A clean code can be download from my GitHub: ESP32_SSD1306_Test. Note that you must have the 2 files on your Arduino IDE if you use a modified font.. Let's now display on the OLED, the temperature, and humidity captured by the DHT22 sensor. In our loop() function, we will have:. The function getDHT() is the one used before. The new function here is the displayData(), that is shown below:. The above photo shows the final result, You can download the complete file from my GitHub: ESP32_DHT22_SSD1306. Usually, it is very important when capturing data with sensors, to also register the time, when it was collected. Let's use the NTPClient library for that:. Change the line:. by: . Enter with your WiFi network credentials. At Serial monitor, you must see the actual time. At basic version, a European time will be shown. At advanced version, you can change it.. Now, let's merge this TimeStamp code with the one developed before. The result is shown in above photos.. The complete code can be downloaded from my GitHub: ESP32_Time_Stamp_DHT22_SSD1306. On last step we put all together, having a fixed display with 3 information:. But, how we can have each one of that information be shown one at a time at the display?. We will need a ""page selection"" mechanism. There are several different mechanisms to be used. Usually with multiple buttons, selecting menus. Just for fun, let's try something not usual here. The potentiometer!. We will turn the potentiometer like we do with a radio dial, and depending on the value read, we will define one specific ""display"" to be shown at OLED. Let's define 4 possible displays:. The Analog Input can read 4,095 different values. We need only 5, so let's define ranges for that:. Let's define a int variable that will receive as content: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 5, depending of screen to be shown:. Now we need to create a function, getDisplay(), that will read the value of potentiometer, returning the correct display number (displayNum will be a local variable inside this function). The function will look like:. And the displayData() function, will display the selected display (or screen):. Both functions will be included in our loop() function:. There is a lot left to be explored with this great IoT device. We will return soon with new tutorials! Keep following MJRoBot tutorials! As always, I hope this project can help others find their way in the exciting world of electronics, robotics, and IoT!. Please visit my GitHub for updated files: ESP32 SSD1306. For more projects, please visit my blog: MJRoBot.org.. Saludos from the south of the world! See you at my next tutorial!. Thank you,. Marcelo. "
"Build a beautiful Holiday Shadow Theater and control the animated scene with your phone.. Read up about this project on . Build a beautiful Holiday Shadow Theater and control the animated scene with your phone.. This project uses an Arduino 101, a strip of addressable LEDs, foam-core and cardstock paper to create a phone-controllable animated Shadow Theater. The electronics are used non-destructively, so you can easily use them later for another project.  Here's a handy Sparkfun wishlist with 99% of the electronics.. How it works: . One strip of addressable LEDs is wrapped over a piece of foam-core in the middle of the Shadow Theater.  The lights near the bottom are slowly fired in sequence and shine through pinholes to create an animated shadow.  Lights further up are channeled into the buildings on top, and the last LED on the strip is used to shine on the whole scene, creating the main shadow.  . The Arduino 101 has a Bluetooth radio built-in, and I use a quick prototyping app called Blynk to remotely control the scene.  In the example code you can control the colors in the buildings, turn on a flickering fire, and control the brightness of the main shadow light.. . Step 1. Collect the end harness from your LED strip by cutting about 1 cm from the end of the lights. Strip the wire ends.. Step 2. Break apart the bent header pins that came with your voltage regulator, and solder two of them to the ends of the green and yellow wires.  This will let you easily plug them into the pins of the Arduino 101. . Step 3. Next solder the red wire to the VIN terminal on the Voltage Regulator, and solder two straight headers into the GND and VOUT pins as shown.. Step 4. Now connect the barrel jack adapters. First strip the ends of the wires coming from your battery case, then mount them in the terminals of the male barrel jack and tighten with a screwdriver. RED goes to the (+) terminal, BLACK goes to the (-) terminal.. Next connect the female barrel jack adapter onto to the loose wires coming from the beginning of the LED strip. YELLOW goes to the (-) terminal, and RED goes to the (+).  . Step 5. Now connect your harness to the Arduino 101. The GREEN wire goes to PIN 6, the YELLOW wire goes to the GND pin near #13. . With the two header pins on the voltage regulator, GND goes to GND and VOUT goes to the ""Vin"" pin on the Arduino 101.  Don't get this wrong!  Plugging in backwards leads to smells and burns. I know this. . Print the foam-core pattern on regular printer paper (4 sheets) and print out the cardstock pattern on cardstock paper (4 sheets.) . Step 1 . Take the printed foam-core pattern pages and use them to cut out your foam-core pieces.  You can lay a pattern on the foam-core, then lightly trace the outline with a hobby knife to transfer the lines through.. Step 2. Once you have the pieces cut, start by assembling the LED strip holder like so:. Now take your LED strip and attach the first LED to the bottom with tape or hot glue, and wrap your LEDs as shown.  The idea is to keep the LED strip intact.  It doesn't need to be a super tight wrap. . Once you've made three wraps, leave the tail end free and secure the top with tape or hot glue.. Step 3. This LED strip has addressable LEDs, meaning you can more or less say, ""hey, you in the middle, turn red!"" But they don't answer to ""hey you,"" so you need to know their numbers. . The LEDs below the crease will shine out the back of the Shadow Theater and be used for animation. In the example below, my animation lights are 0, 1, 2, 20, 21, 22, 40, 41, 42. Two LEDs in the top section will shine up into the houses.  I use LED 23 to shine up  into the back house, and 25 to simulate firelight in the front houses. . Count out your LEDs and draw a simple reference map that makes sense to you so you can enter appropriate LED numbers into the code later. Remember to start your count at the beginning of the strip starting with zero, because computers.. Step 4. Glue the LED holder down onto the foam-core bottom piece.  Position it as shown and so the wide stripe of lights is roughly centered lengthwise with the base.. Now add the curved foam-core side pieces on the ends with hot glue as shown.. Step 5. Now add the light dividers and the foam-core top piece. The light dividers keep the animation lights from spilling up into the houses, and vice-versa. Position the largest divider close to the crease in the LED holder, and position the smaller divider above it so at least one LED is between them (see photos below.)  Position the top piece so it's square with the base as shown in the slideshow below and secure with hot glue.. Step 6. Attach the end of the LED strip to the front top edge with hot glue so the last LED in the string can shine on the scene. This is the main shadow LED.. Connect a USB programming cable to the Arduino 101, and connect the LED strip, battery pack and Arduino 101 all together (leave the power switch on the battery pack to ""off.""). You'll need the Arduino IDE installed on your computer, with the Intel Curie Core (see Arduino 101 getting started.)  You'll also need to install the Adafruit Neopixel library, and the Blynk library.  . If you're new to Arduino, it's a good idea to run some basic example sketches to be sure everything's working OK.  . Step 1. Install the Blynk app on your phone. . Blynk is a great tool for rapid proof-of-concept building and remote controlling your Arduino 101. BLE support still has some bugs, but Blynk is by far the fastest way I've found to control any Arduino 101 project from a phone.. Step 2. Load the example code in your Arduino IDE and change the LED pixel numbers if necessary using the map you made earlier. . The program animates through the LED numbers in the ""pos[ ]"" array to create the illusion of falling snow. Change these numbers if needed to match your setup, (the animation LEDs are the ones below the crease on your LED holder.) Arrange the numbers in the order you want them to fire. The lights project through pinholes to make the ""snow,"" so lighting from the bottom to top will make snow appear to fall down, left to right will make snow appear to blow from right to left.. Next set how many pixels will animate. Then set the pixel that is at the end of the strand shining on the scene (on a 60 pixel strip, this is pixel #59.). Choose a pixel for the lights that will shine up into the rear house.  This pixel should be between the two light dividers.. Finally, set the number of the pixel that will be shining up into the front houses to be the ""fire pixel.""  This pixel should be just in front of the smaller light divider. . When the code above is changed as needed, you can compile and upload to your Arduino 101.  Once the code is successfully uploaded, disconnect your USB cable and turn the power switch on the battery pack to ""on.""  You should see the shadowPixel turn on, and the animation pixels will light in sequence. The house and fire pixels will be off until you control them with Blynk.. Step 3. Loading your Blynk app:. Open the Blynk app on your phone and press the ""scan"" button near the upper right.  Scan this QR code and the controller interface should automatically load and you'll be all set.. When loaded, the interface should look like this:. If you prefer to build your Blynk interface manually instead of scanning the code above, start with with a BLE widget and 3 sliders set to output 0-100 to VO, V1 and V2. . Step 4. Connect over BLE to your Arduino 101. Tap the BLE widget and if your Arduino 101 is powered on, you should see ""ShadowTheater."" Connect, then hit the ""play"" arrow icon in the upper right to control your project.  You may need to reconnect after your phone goes to sleep.. OK all done with the hard stuff, now on to crafting!  You can turn everything off until the final reveal.. Step 1. Find your four printed card-stock sheets. Using a hobby knife and fresh blades, cut out the background silhouette.  Change the blade frequently! Cutting with a dull blade is super frustrating. I changed the blade 3 times cutting out this silhouette. . Step 2. Cut out the house pieces and attach the backs with hot glue.  The printed sides should face back, so you can't see any ink from the front.  Scroll through the photos below.. . Step 3. Add the houses to the stage.  You can use hot glue or tape. Try to close all gaps so the light goes into the houses but doesn't spill around the sides.. Step 4. Now fold the sides of the silhouette sheet and attach the bottom to the back edge of the stage with hot glue. (face the printed side away from the viewer.). Step 5. Cut out a snow scene to project on the wall behind the shadow theater.  You can use pins or toothpicks, or cut out intricate shapes.  Once the sheet is done, hot glue it to the curved edges to create a projection surface.. Step 6. Attach the left side and front sheets with hot glue. . Loosely attach the right side sheet with tape, so you can still get at the inside to turn the power on and off at the battery case.. All done!  Find a dark area with a wall nearby to try it out!  When you first turn the power on, the Shadow Theater should cast a scene shadow and falling snow.  With the Blynk app, you can control the main light, and the lights in the buildings. . "

The sump level monitor was built to work with an Ecobee RSM-01 input board I have in my daughter's home or my Home Monitor project.  I added a relay to allow it to stand alone.  I wanted something I felt would be more reliable and easier to install than an ultrasonic sensor.  To this end, I started looking into pressure sensors and finally came across Freescale MPXV5010DP.  It has a 0-5vdc output for 0-10kPa, which would be about 1020mm of water head.. Since I wanted local indication, I chose an OLED module to use in the design.  Cheap, bright and this one had a two color screen.  To provide interface, I added a relay for a dry contact output.  I added a DAC (digital to analog converter) for a 0-5vdc output with more power than the MPXV5010DP sensor, this will also protect the sensor from possible wiring damage.  Since I am using I2C communication, all is need is software changes to supply data to another Arduino.. I designed and had built a custom board for ease of connections.  It provides enough flexibility for different configurations.. The sensor is connected by tygon tubing to a copper pipe that gets routed down into the sump.  This allows for some discretion as to where to mount the monitor and keeps it away from the water itself...

"In this project we show how we made a single-lead ECG monitor for  heart-rate variability using the MAX30003 and an Arduino Uno. . Read up about this project on . In this project we show how we made a single-lead ECG monitor for  heart-rate variability using the MAX30003 and an Arduino Uno. . Have you felt it when your heart ""skips a beat"" OR a ""flutter"" in your heart? If you're wondering what it was, its called an ""arrhythmia"". Not to worry, general heart-rate variability (HRV) is normal and dependent on emotional arousal, although some types of arrhythmias can indicate cardiac anomalies.  . What we want to present in this article is a unique and easy way to measure ECG as well as R-R intervals with surprisingly high accuracy.. ECG/EKG (Electro-cardiogram) is an electrical signal taken from electrodes connected to the body and its an electrical signal. Compared to optical means of heart rate measurement, the ECG still provides the most accurate heart rhythm.. A single ECG waveform is made up of the P,Q,R,S,T points as shown in the picture below. Each of these is of significance in a detailed cardiac study and is not possible to explain everything here. Of particular interest to us relevant to this project is what is called the ""QRS"" complex. Part of this QRS complex is the ""R"" apex point which corresponds to the depolarization of the right and left ventricles of the heart.. What we are now interested in is the distance between two R peaks in a continuously displayed or recorded ECG measurement. The time it takes for the heart to produce two consecutive R peaks is known as the R-R interval and which is of significance for HRV studies.. The R-R interval is generally used to detect several different kinds of arrhythmias (which are quite a few) and not all of them will not be discussed here.. Besides the clinical significance of heart-rate variability, there is a physiological significance too. Reduced HRV is also an indicator of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity, which includes emotional arousal and other functions of the autonomous nervous system. This means that R-R intervals can be indirect ""markers"" for phycological activity.. There are several ECG AFE chips available including those from TI and Analog Devices. ProtoCentral also carries the popular ADS1292R-chip based breakout board. But the new features of the MAX30003 have us all excited:. We used the ProtoCentral Single-lead ECG monitor breakout board based on the MAX30003 single-channel AFE chip from Maxim Integrated to acquire ECG using two electrodes connected to the chest.  This board is connected to an Arduino Uno using a standard SPI interface. Connections are made as given in the following table:. Unlike the traditional 3-electrode system which requires a driven right leg (DRL) electrode for common mode rejection, the MAX30003 is very unique in the fact that it works off of 2 electrodes only, making it easier to use.. The Arduino sketch for use with this hookup reads the real-time ECG and R-to-R interval data from the MAX30003 over SPI, puts it in a data packet and sends it over the Uno's USB-UART interface. This Arduino sketch is available in the links at the end of this article.. We also made a GUI with processing that takes this data from the serial port and plots the data in real-time with also the R-to-R interval time (in milliseconds) and the instantaneous heart rate *based on the current R-R value. . The R-to-R interval displayed here is the time between the last detected R peak and the previously detected R peak to get an instantaneous value of the R-R interval as well as heart rate. The instantaneous heart rate would be different from the regular heart-rate(if you would use a medical monitor) in the fact that generally heart-rate is calculated from a window of 5-10 secs of stored ECG data, rather that taking the immediate time.. Check out our video for the device in action. . We had a good experience interfacing with this board and assured that it can save the user a lot of time otherwise writing robust R-R detection algorithms. We have done testing to show that it is quite robust, although more testing has to be done to test the device for robustness.   . We would like to see what can be made with this board, including internet-connected arrhythmia monitoring patches and even some kind of emotion monitor that uses the parasympathetic nervous system's correlation with R-R to detect change in emotions. We will soon post another Hackster article about the performance of this device in the presence of motion artifacts. Please leave your ides in the comments below. . "
"Wearable for monitoring the health condition of patients who have suffered or are in risk of having a cardiac arrest.. Read up about this project on . Wearable for monitoring the health condition of patients who have suffered or are in risk of having a cardiac arrest.. PHA will help the city of Las Vegas to meet its Community Risk Reduction goal and increase survival from sudden cardiac arrest. . Each year, approximately 300,000 people in the United States experience an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). An OHCA is defined as cessation of cardiac mechanical activity that occurs outside of the hospital setting and is confirmed by the absence of signs of circulation. . Whereas an OHCA can occur from non-cardiac causes, the majority (70%--85%) of such events have a cardiac cause. Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) data confirm that patients who receive CPR from bystanders have a greater chance of surviving OHCA than those who do not. . The mean age at cardiac arrest is 64.0 years. On average:. Although 36.7% of OHCA events were witnessed by a bystander, only 43.8% of these arrests involved persons who received bystander CPR, and only 3.7% of those persons were treated with an AED before the arrival of 911. . Factors positively associated with short-term survival after OHCA are:  . More than 65% unwitnessed  arrest occur at home and probably without any person close by to help (bystander witness). . This personal assistant could stay close to potential cardiac arrest patients and provide guidance and/or execute  the critical actions to improve chances of survival (chain of survival):. PHA is a wearable that can detect when people faint or fall (potentially due to a cardiac problem), record messages, and automatically call for 9-1-1 services providing the address, and send alerts to neighbors previously trained in CPR technique and or they can be guided through it with Alexa's assistance. . Alexa can also be activated using voice commands such as “Alexa, I need help, please call 911,” and a voice with a pre-recorded message will be made to both medical services and emergency contacts (neighbors and relatives).. PHA is a wearable based in Curie Intel processor that collaborates with the Amazon Echo Alexa to monitor people´s health.. Using a 6-axis accelerometer, PHA can detect when a person faints or falls, and automatically sends an alarm request to medical services and previously registered emergency contacts. The person can also request help using an Alexa skill which is activated with the command ""Alexa, help. Call emergency."". In case that the person is not injured when they fall, the emergency call could  be cancelled within the first  minute, using the command ""Alexa, I am OK."".

"This project is a platform for drinking water monitoring and analytics, consists of IoT device, cloud, and mobile and web app.. Read up about this project on . This project is a platform for drinking water monitoring and analytics, consists of IoT device, cloud, and mobile and web app.. This project focuses on one of the most vital nutrient for our body, drinking water. In Indonesia, the term ""gallon"" refers to an infrastructure for drinking water: water dispenser, and replaceable water bottle, as apparently the water bottle measurement is in gallon unit.. Detail background and thoughts behind this project are described in my project idea here, that I use for idea submission to World Largest Arduino Maker Challenge. The key objective of the project is building solution around the new Arduino MKR1000.. The project is a simplified version of my company’s real product called HomeX - Smart Gallon. Please note that the product itself is copyrighted.. We decide to share the project's source code and design, as an effort to share to the community, and it's intended to showcase:. Before telling much about what it's all about, let's take a look this video:. How It Looks Like. IoT Device. The device prototype case is made from clear acrylic for now to show the internals. It is bigger than it should be, as many components, especially MKR1000, are still put on board through female header.. Web-based Dashboard. For monitoring and controlling devices from web browser.. Live website: http://home-x.cloudapp.net:9000  . Test account:. *Please note that the device's dashboard may not show any data if the actual device is not turned on.. Windows 10 UWP App. An app installable on Windows 10 tablet, desktop, and phone, used to manage Gallon devices, monitor water level and other data, and also set actions to perform upon triggered low water level. . For signing-in to the app, you can use the same test account as dashboard.. System Architecture. Such a simple use case doesn't mean it is simple under the hood. . IoT Device. Key components:. Capacitive Sensor. I want to highlight the capacitive sensor. It's used to measure water level inside the bottle by measuring capacitance value at the sensor electrode upon water existence. For measuring capacitance, we leverage MPR121 module, that supports up to 12 electrodes. By using this kind of sensor, it means that the sensor doesn't have to be physically in touch with water like the one with floating mechanism, or tube-based.. Software. Developing software for the IoT device means developing firmware for Arduino MKR1000. It's developed using Arduino framework for specific platform target: ""hackster.io - MKR1000 build"". . All source code is published on GitHub at this link. For coding it, I don't use official Arduino IDE, instead I use Arduino Eclipse IDE. To properly open and build the code project, make sure to download and install the Arduino Eclipse IDE V3.. Used 3rd parties libraries:. Azure Services. Azure is the heart of the platform. Beside for ingestion device-to-cloud telemetry data, it's also used for sending cloud-to-device messages (or commands), and later for further analysis (hot or cold path) of ingested data stream. Following Azure services are used:. a. Azure IoT Hub. It's crucial component that's front-facing of IoT devices, as it's used for ingesting data stream from IoT devices and sending command to them.. Communications between Azure IoT Hub and IoT devices are done entirely with native MQTT protocol over secure communication based on TLS/SSL. At the time of developing this project, Azure IoT Hub already supported MQTT v3.1.1. More on MQTT support in Azure Iot Hub is here.. Azure IoT Hub publishes Event Hub compatible endpoint that's later used by Azure Stream Analytics for further analysis. The endpoint is also used by Node.js-based backend for telemetry data storage and relay to client apps (UWP and web app) through web socket.. b. Azure Stream Analytics Job. In this project, Azure Stream Analytics is used to process data stream received by Azure IoT Hub in realtime. One of processing that's currently performed is for knowing the rate of water level changes.. Fortunately, Azure Stream Analytics Job already supported input directly from IoT Hub. As for output, currently Azure Table Storage is used for now, but you can use another, Power BI for example. . As for analysis query, for now, I use this query:. It seems that the query still can be improved. . For reference, here's the payload sample ingested by IoT Hub:. Applying that query and using that input data sample, we can get the output something like this:. From that output, now we know how fast the water level change from one percentage to another. Further analysis will reveal how soon the water in the bottle will be fully empty.. c. Azure Storage Account. For current project, Azure Storage Account, especially table storage, is used as the output of Azure Stream Analytics Job.. d. Azure Virtual Machine. Virtual Machine is used to host:. Initially it's considered to deploy those on Azure Websites. But for simplicity and reducing cost, we use VM for now.. Please refer to attached project repositories:. And read the README file inside them to properly deploy the software.. Web-based Dashboard App. We leverage Freeboard for creating the dashboard. It's open source project that provides ready-to-use and customizable framework for creating dashboards.. As Freeboard only provides HTML-based frontend framework, we still need to create the backend based on Node.js for:. Some key Node.js modules used:. One thing to note that the data displayed on dashboard doesn't directly coming from Azure IoT Hub. Although Freeboard supports data source from MQTT broker and Azure IoT Hub does support MQTT, but that requires us to set the MQTT password which is device's SAS token on dashboard itself! So instead, data from IoT Hub relayed to dashboard via web socket by Gallon Watcher backend, and that's why data source on Freeboard dashboard is socket.io.. Windows 10 UWP App. As its premise, Universal Windows Platform allows to develop app targeted for Windows 10 tablet, desktop, and phone based on one codebase. Apparently, we can achieve that by creating this Visual Studio project.. Similar to web-based dashboard, UWP app doesn't receive data directly from Azure IoT Hub, but instead from Gallon Watcher backend via web socket.. Used  libraries that you can install using NuGet:. To properly replicate the system in your own environment, especially from software-side, please refer to README file inside each repositories.. As for deploying used Azure services, please follow deployment guideline for each services. No special consideration needed. Some needed parameters:. Initial state of IoT device, after the first time MKR1000 is flashed, is not connected to internet. We can setup the device's WiFi connection by using UWP app provided. To sign-in to UWP app and Web-based dashboard, use the provided test account.. Few areas to improve:. This project has successfully implemented water level monitoring solution, that leverages Arduino MKR1000, Microsoft Azure services, Microsoft Universal Windows Platform, and Node.js. There are some areas of improvement as noted above.. This project also shows the proper development technique and toolset for developing Arduino software, for the perspective of software developer. My 19 years coding experience really plays much here :). That's it. Enjoy.. "

This tutorial shows how to control an array of 8x8 LED matrices using an Arduino Uno, to create the face of a robot.. . This project shows how to control an array of 8x8 LED matrices using an Arduino Uno. This guide might be used to create a simple (and relatively cheap display) for your own projects. This way you might display letters, numbers or custom animations.. A 5 matrix array used in one of our robot projects (""Robô da Alegria"") is used as an example to illustrate this technology. You might be interested in learning more about this project in the following links:. . Notice that you'll need two types of jumpers: female-to-female for the connection between the matrices and a male-to-female for the connection of the first matrix to the Arduino.. The number of components may vary according to the structure you have in mind.. Connect all the components according to the schematic. You'll need some jumper wires to connect the first matrix to the Arduino, and each matrix to the next one on the array.. Arduino Pinout:. You might also want to arrange each display in a given position. For that you might use the acrylic sheet, some screws and nuts (four for each display) and place each component in position. No tool is needed to assemble the circuit, but you will need a screwdriver if you wish attach the displays to a surface. In our example, five displays were placed in a face pattern (two eyes and a mouth). Plug the USB cable to the Arduino Uno board and proceed to the next step.. With the latest Arduino IDE version installed, add the LedControl.h library, which is used to control the LEDs. Download, compile and upload Arduino the code, which is divided in 4 parts:. setIntensity was used to limit LEDs brightness. It was set as 1 (in a scale from 0 to 15) in order to reduce the power consumption of the modules to a level acceptable by the USB port.. After the upload keep the Arduino connected to the USB port of your computer and open the Serial Monitor. The code is programmed to display a set of emoticons on the LED face, depending on the message received by the serial port. The following commands were configured:. For the eyes. For the mouth:. Type a pair of characters (on for the eyes and other for the mouth) in the serial monitor, press enter and the displays will be updated according to your command.. You might change the drawings (add new faces for instance) or change the control method (including a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi interface), according to your needs.. Have fun!. "
"Let us predict the changes around us with Arduino. Read up about this project on . Let us predict the changes around us with Arduino. Recently my college had a small science exhibition .So i was requested by my teacher to present a project in the college to teach young students about electronics so basically i had two days to make some thing.. As the climatic conditions over here are varies a lot and recently the temperature is somewhere around 34-40 degree Celsius. So i decided to make a weather station.. So what does a weather station do  ?. A weather station is a device that collects data related to the weather and environment using many different sensors. Sensors like . The aim is to make a portable weather station. Features it should have. So here is the thing we will need for the project. I actually started the project on My UNO but then i decide to switch to compact solution.. I had the nano with me at that moment so had to go with it , would love to use micro,because it is the smallest.. Anyways leaving those things,talking about budget and parts here is the list .. For tool end you will need. And Also some time. Measuring the temperature can be made using different sensor.. The popular ones are DHT22,DHT11,SHT1x. So basically, lets understand how this sensor are different from each other and why i have used DHT22 in the first place.. AM2302 output calibrated digital signal. It applys exclusive digital-signal-collecting-technique and humidity sensing technology, assuring its reliability and stability. Its sensing elements is connected with 8-bit single-chip computer.. Every sensor of this model is temperature compensated and calibrated in accurate calibration chamber and the calibration-coefficient is saved in type of programme in OTP memory, when the sensor is detecting, it will cite coefficientfrommemory. Smallsize&lowconsumption&longtransmissiondistance(100m)enableAM2302tobesuitedinallkindsof harshapplicationoccasions.Single-rowpackagedwithfourpins,makingtheconnectionveryconvenient.. Lets see some pros and cons of the three.. DHT11. Pros：No soldering needed. Cheapest among three. Get stable output quickly. Transmission over 20m. Strong interference. . Cons：Library! No resolution option. Errors: Temp+/-2°C; Humid+/-5%RH. Inadequate measuring range(0-50°C). Applications：Gardening, Agriculture. . DHT22. Pros：No soldering needed. Adding a few bucks to DHT11 and get an upgrade. Smooth curve. Smallest error. Large range. Transmission over 20m. Strong interference.. Cons：Can be more sensitive. Slow temperature tracking. Library needed. Applications：Environmental Monitoring.  SHT1x. Pros：No soldering. Smooth curve. Small error. Quick response. Low power consumption. Auto sleep. Extraordinary long term stability and consistency. . Cons：Two digital interfaces. Humidity error. Same measuring range with DHT11. Library needed. Applications：Heavy duties and longtime installations.   Following are three relatively cheap choices.. Connection. Vcc to 5V or 3.3V. Gnd to Gnd. Data to pin 2 of arduino. The bmp180  a barometric pressure sensor with an I2C (“Wire”) interface.. Barometric pressure sensors measure the absolute pressure of the air around them. This pressure varies with both the weather and altitude.. this bmp180 module came with a 3.3 v regulator 662k which i blew up to some stupidity so i attached a wire to by pass the whole vcc directly to the chip.. Note : On Doing so i restrict myself from using only 3.3 v ,using voltages above it will ruin the device.. Other model may not have the 662k voltage regulator. so check thoroughly .. Ok coming back lets  connect the sensor to the arduino .. The sensor connects to the i2c bus of the arduino which of nano and Uno are . SDA==>A4. SCL==>A5. VCC==>3.3V. GND ==> GND. Lets talk about pressure a little  and how does pressure measure altitude and temperature.. The atmospheric pressure at any position is not constant.The complex interaction between the earth’s spin, axis tilt, and many other factors result in moving areas of higher and lower pressure, which in turn cause the variations in weather we see every day. By watching for changes in pressure, you can predict short-term changes in the weather.. For example, dropping pressure usually means wet weather or a storm is approaching (a low-pressure system is moving in). Rising pressure usually means that clear weather is approaching (a high-pressure system is moving through).. Atmospheric pressure also varies with altitude. The absolute pressure in Mt .everest base camp (5,400 )is lower than Delhi(216). Since Abosolute pressure is difficult to directly compare pressure measurements from one location to another.we use the relative pressure .that is sea level pressure.. Measuring altitude . The average pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 1013.25 hPa (or mbar). This drops off to zero as you climb towards the vacuum of space. Because the curve of this drop-off is well understood, you can compute the altitude difference between two pressure measurements (p and p0) by using this equation:. alti=44330*[1-(p/p0)^(1/5.255)]. If you use sea level pressure (1013.25 hPa) as the baseline pressure (p0), the output of the equation will be your current altitude above sea level.. Precautions. Give it air: Remember that the BMP180 needs access to ambient air to measure its pressure, so don’t put it in a sealed case. Providing a small vent hole should be adequate.But not too much air: On the other hand, exposure to fast-moving air or wind can cause momentary pressure variations that will affect your readings. Shield the device from strong air currents..  Keep it cool: Because an accurate temperature reading is needed to measure the pressure, try not to expose the device to rapid temperature changes, and keep it away from nearby hot parts and other heat sources. . Keep it dry: The BMP180 is sensitive to moisture. Don’t submerge it or allow it to contact liquid water. . Don’t blind it: Surprisingly, the silicon within the BMP180 is sensitive to light, which can enter the device through the hole on the top of the chip. For maximum accuracy, shield the chip from ambient light.. So we start by making the header for the nano. we actually cut the female headers and then file them to make them look as if they were originally that size.we then solder it. then we made the headers for DHT22 sensor. . it needed a 10k resistance to be connected from the data to ground. we then soldered everything.Then it was time for the bmp180 we added the header in a similar manner.We used 3.3 V as the power .We connected all the i2c bus. . We added lastly the display  we are using i2c lcd so w used the same bus we used for the bmp180 module.. (There is a fourth slot in which i wanted to add rtc module later to also incoperate clock in the machine ). Wait .....................

Here an easy way to get your certificate arn if you have not noted it down is to go to the AWS IoT console click on you certificate and go to details on the right hand side of your screen. From here you can copy paste the arn to the teminal. . . For more info refer to the documentation on . http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/secure-communication.html.  . . # 10 Verifying/testing your setup on your computer and test it using MQTT.fx. Now to claim that the setup is done on your computer , download and install MQTT.fx from link below to test if the setup is working and we are able to publish and suscribe for data via AWS IoT. http://mqttfx.jfx4ee.org/index.php/download. For more setup info and to download the root cert use the link below. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/verify-pub-sub.html. - here in MQTT.fx you will have to setup your connection profile. - and link your certs which you downloaded as part of the steps above. Here is a quick video that show how you can test you setup on you computer which in my case is a MAC using MQTT.fx tool.. . . Once you have complete and tested that your setup is fine follow the steps below to upload the certificated to the Arduino Yun. #11 Setting up the Arduino Yun to communicate with AWS IoT cloud. Download  the latest version of the Arduino Yun SDK from github and unzip into your Arduino ""Libraries"" folder . https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-arduino-yun. If you are using the Arduino Yun for the first time follow the setup instructions at. https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoYun . Basically using the link you will learn how to set up the Arduino Yun to connect to home WiFi network.. Then load the Process Example sketch Arduino IDE to your YUN (File->Examples->Bridge -> Process), this will confirm that the Yun has access to the internet . Put your rootCA file, private key and certificate into certs folder as shown in the screen shot below. . Next modify codebase_upload.sh and environment_setup.sh and replace [your_boards_IP] with your board’s IP address and [your_boards_IP] with your password. In the your terminal run the following commands to give permission to the .sh files ,this will take about 5-10 mins ,which moves the certs and installs distribute, python-openssl, pip, paho-mqtt on the Yun. These are the packages you need to communicate with the AWS cloud from your Yun(aka called the PlantSystem thing in our case). .  . . For installation on Linux/Windows follow the link at . https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-arduino-yun#installation. . Now as part of the next couple using AWS CLI we are going create a table in DynamoDB to post sensor data. #12 Creating an IAM role and granting permisions. Basically to enter data into the DynamoDB sensor table which we are going to create as part of the next step , we need to create a IoT rule that will act upon the MQTT message received by AWS, for this we need to create a role and grant it necessary permisions. Create a json file rolePolicy.json. and to create the role run the following command in the terminal. Create another json file policy.json. . then call create-policy and specify the IAM policy document. And finally attach the policy to the role using - modify the policy-ARN to the ARN that you received as part of the previous step. . http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/config-and-test-rules.html. #13 Setting up table in DynamoDB in AWS console. As part of this step we are going to create a DynamoDB in the AWS console. Table Name : plantSensor. Partition key : key. Sort key : timestamp. and also set your Read capacity units and Write capacity to 1.. #14 Creating a rule to insert data into PlantSensor Table. Create a json file - plantdatarule.json (here modify the roleArn value in section below, go to IAM->Roles->iot-action-role to get the arn). . then run the following command on your terminal. Now if you go to the AWS IoT console you should see a rule created called ""PlantDataToDynamoDB""  as shown in the screen shot below('' ignore the email send rule this is coming as part of the steps below.). using MQTT.FX run a quick test to see if records are getting created in the table created.. . #15 Upload the Arduino sketch to publish data to AWS IoT from the Yun. Here first start of by downloading the ArduinoJSON  library from github at. https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson. Now download the YunAWSIoTDynamoDB,ino and aws_iot_config.h files from the  code section below and upload it to the Yun.. Open your Serial monitor and you should see the temperature, Light Value and soil moisture value posted to the DynamoDB.. If you have have been AWS you can do all kinds of awesome stuff by setting up Lambda function and posting data kinesis .... Note: If you plan on making this a permanent setup, don't forget to increase the delay at the end of the loop , to increase the time interval of posting to DynamoDB so that you do not incur addition cost . For more on pricing refer to https://aws.amazon.com/iot/pricing/. . #16 Setting up a AWS-IoT SNS rule to receive and email if your soil moisture value fall below a threshold. . Basically this step includes setting up a simple SNS notification base on AWS IoT rule.. Start of by assigning the following policies to the AWS role (iot-action-role) that you created in the previous step in the IAM console. -AmazonSNSRole. -AmazonSNSFullAccess. Once done in the SNS console create a Topic called sendMail and create a subscription and give your email configure on you phone to get notified when the soil moisture value is LOW.. Now head back to the AWS IoT console and using the +Create Resource button create a rule called Email Send and provide the following info. Once done you console should look like the screen shot below. Here is an sample email I recived when I removed the soil moisture sensor from a glass of water. . . . To read more about AWS-SNS. https://aws.amazon.com/sns/faqs/ . #15 Putting the 3D printed parts together and adding it to the pot.. You will need a 4x40 screw and nut to attach the black soil poker 3D printed part to the base part of the Arduino Yun. The top part just snap fits , here remember to point the top opening toward you window and poke the Soil moisture in the pot.And power the Yun with a micro usb cable plug to a wall outlet.. Please note, I am still exploring and learning about the awesome world of AWS, and awe'd by the features on the AWS console,so if you have been using AWS for quite some time, post a comment or suggestion for feature you would have liked to see/applicable to the plant monitoring project.Thanks ... .

"A SparkFun Artemis powered urban quality monitoring system with IoT capability and TensorFlow Lite based machine learning implementation.. Read up about this project on . A SparkFun Artemis powered urban quality monitoring system with IoT capability and TensorFlow Lite based machine learning implementation.. The metro cities all around the world are facing a lot of problem because of the increasing population, which is resulting in an exponential pollution rise, which is a very serious problem and needs immediate attention.. But the problem is that there is no proper monitoring device for these urban environments, so we are unable to get any reliable data. Even if there are devices to monitor the conditions, they are in limited number due to the current cost - to - reliability and accuracy count.. The SparkUQM -  designed specifically for urban environments. Please note that I have designed this device keeping in mind the Indian metro city conditions, as cities like Delhi are one of the most polluted cities in the world when it comes to air pollution. . So, let us get started!. So, the components are already mentioned in the project. But, let us have a look at each of them in brief:. 1) The Spark fun Artemis Contest Kit 1  - This kit contains. 2) Various Seeed Grove Sensors. Note that normal sensors will be just fine. I am using these as I have a lot of them lying around. The sensors I have used are:. 3) Particle Photon - This small WiFi powered development board will be used to add IoT capabilities to our project. This will fetch the sensor data serially and then send it to your desired cloud.. 4) Apart from this, just a USB power bank will be required to power the whole device. That's all!. So, let us get started with the project:. Now, I will show the hardware connections for this project with a image. For more details, just go and have a look at the code in my Git repo. The main file is very well written and with comments for easy understanding.. I am really sorry that I could not create a flow chart of schematic diagram due to the shortage of time. But be sure that I will add all the additional details later for sure.. Now after the Hardware connections are done, we will get all these things into a cardboard enclosure that I created for this project. So, after everything is attached are glued or taped in its place, the final Hardware would look something like this:. Now that this is done, let us move to the software part!. This part is divided into 3 parts, basically because I have developed my code like that. The first part is the normal code part in which I program the device to work with all the interfaced components.. In the part 2, I add machine learning functionality into the project.. In Part 3, I just describe the Particle Photon code. The code is a little complicated as I have used intensive commenting for easy understanding. So, let us start:. This is the basic Arduino IDE Code for the SparkFun Artemis ATP. The code is pretty much self explanatory if you see, so please just go through it. The name of the file is ""final_code.ino"".You can find the code in the Github repo of this project.. Sorry I will add detailed code explanation later for sure. The project shows all the sensor data on various pages created. These are displayed on the OLED screen. The pages are as follows:. Now that the basic code is all done, we can move on to the main part of this project, which is TensorFlow Lite implementation. I saw that there were just some speech and audio related examples given in Arduino TensorFlow Lite Library. But, they were quite complicated to start with and for some reason, I could not get them to work as expected.. Later, I did some tweaking with the parameters of the TensorFlow Micro speech example and it finally worked! So, I had 2 options now:. I figured that adding voice functionality to this project won't do much good in terms of application, so I decided to go with the 2nd option.. Firstly, I just focused on 2 of the simplest algorithms:. 1. Linear Regression. 2. Logistic Regression. But I couldn't get the desired accuracy on my Linear regression model for predicting air quality (eCO2) values based on past values and the features I used were:. To know more about Linear regression in TensorFlow Lite, just go on and follow this tutorial. Believe me, it is great! Thanks to Particle blogs.. To get some reference data, I used the NXP Rapid IoT prototyping kit.. https://blog.particle.io/particle-machine-learning-101/. The same process can be followed for Arduino IDE too.. But the Loss was too much and I had a time constraint, so Instead I decided to go with Logistic Regression and build a simple binary classifier. But do not worry, I will add the Linear regression Model implementation soon.. Now, training a Binary Classifier can be time consuming when we use a large dataset. So, for this project, I just took into consideration the CO2 and TVOC values, and added an additional parameter AQI to generate training data output. It is pretty simple logic, if the value of TVOC and CO2 is greater than a particular value (in my case, I kept it 1000 just for demo), the AQI value will become 1, else zero.. To get some data, I created a demo program to print the desired data in CSV friendly form on serial monitor and left it running for an hour or tow on any Serial console (I used Putty).. Then I stopped it and downloaded that data in CSV format. The final data will ook something like this:. I managed to get 540 data points, which were more than enough for me. After that, I uploaded this data to google colab Logistic Regression Demo, and then trained the classifier. The link to the google colab notebook is:. https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/mlcc/logistic_regression.ipynb?hl=en. This is the basic example, just change it according to the data you use.. Now, just follow this process to convert the obtained model into.tflite format and finally into a C++ file with values of weights and biases stored in an array.. Once you have a trained model, the next step is to convert that model into something that TensorFlow Lite can work with. TensorFlow proper supports a number of different model file formats, while TensorFlow Lite supports only one, the tflite FlatBuffer format, which is optimized for size and thus perfect for constrained devices.. Once you have a TFLite model, you’ll need to convert it to a C array for use. Many MCU’s (including Particle devices) do not have native filesystem support, which means you’ll need to load your TFLite model into memory in order to use it. The recommended way to do this is to convert your model into a C array and compile it into your project.. On most operating systems, you can do this with the xxd command.. That will yield something that looks like this:. This completes the Machine Learning Part.. Now that everything is set in the SparkFun side of the project, let us move on to the particle photon side, which helps adding IoT capabilities to the project.. The Arduino code sends all the sensor data in JSON Format (using the Arduino JSON Library ) and so we will use the same library to parse this JSON and then we can do anything with this data.. Example: Send it to a database like Firebase so it can be accessed in an Android application. See my earlier project for documentation on this.. This completes our project. Please like if you like this project and follow me for more such content. Thanks to Sparkfun for this wonderful opportunity!.. Adios!. "

"Using a blue laser and phosphorescent paper to illustrate what it means to sketch a sine wave around a circle.. Read up about this project on . Using a blue laser and phosphorescent paper to illustrate what it means to sketch a sine wave around a circle.. Have you ever wondered about how sound editing software can cut or boost the base in a recording?  Or how sound-canceling headphones work?  Or how civil engineers can design buildings and avoid the resonant frequencies of earthquakes?  Well, the answer to all of those questions originates with one man: Joseph Fourier.  Fourier figured out how to mathematically brake a complex wave down into its component sine waves, allowing each to be edited or observed individually.  The general idea (without getting into the calculus behind it) is that you take the wave and wrap it around a circle so that it draws a type of flower.  You then gradually increase the frequency at which you wind the wave around that circle, watching the shapes that the graph draws change.  You do this until you find a frequency that draws something that looks like a heart shape.  When you find that, it means that the frequency at which you are winding the wave around the circle is the same as the frequency of one of the component sine waves in the parent wave you are analyzing.  I decided to make a physical representation of that process of finding the component sine waves.  . . The idea that we (Henry Haggart and I) came up with is to have a rotating circle of phosphorescent paper which you can control the speed of under a linear actuator with a blue laser attached to it.  The idea is that the linear actuator with the laser would trace a sine wave as you altered the speed at which the circle turned to try and find where they matched and you started to draw hearts instead of flowers.  This could be easily achieved by driving two separate stepper motors and using the input from a rotary encoder to change the speed at which the base circle rotates.  The rest of the physical design was relatively rudimentary, as we only needed a way to suspend the laser above the base circle on a custom fabricated linear actuator which we laser cut from acrylic.  . . . Programming this device, while it wasn’t excessively hard, did present some unexpected challenges for me.  Firstly, I had never worked with Arduino and steppers, and so did not think about the mechanics of the setSpeed function.  What the speed does is just add a different delay between steps in the program.  This was a problem for us, as every time the delay changed in the sine wave generator code, it would also change the speed of the base circle.  As it was getting dangerously close to exhibition time, the quick fix was to simply run the two motors off of two different boards.  This was a way to make the code much more readable and (more importantly) debuggable.  Later on, however, I learned about a way to run the two codes together on the same Arduino without having the delay in the sine function effect the delay in the base circle.  . Here is the code snippet that allowed us to do that:  . The millis() function in the Arduino IDE is a timer function, so its value counts at a constant rate no matter the delays that you may have in your code.  What this does is looks for when millis() has counted up a certain increment (value or your base circle speed) and when that condition is met, it takes one step forward with the base stepper motor..

"The Scent-terrific Smart Candle is made of wax, flickers like a real flame, emits scents though a wax warmer, and is controllable by Alexa! . Read up about this project on . The Scent-terrific Smart Candle is made of wax, flickers like a real flame, emits scents though a wax warmer, and is controllable by Alexa! . The Scent-terrific Smart Candle is a smart lighting and aromatherapy system for the home or office. . I love smart lighting. I've got seven wall switches, a smart bulb, and a smart plug (connected to a lamp) in my home. I've even built my own smart lamp.. Unfortunately, I haven't found the same innovation when it comes to other lighting apparatus. I haven't seen a smart night light on the market. I think smart lamps can be better. . Smart candles are the worse; most don't look like candles. They don't smell like candles. They aren't controllable by voice.  . I've been thinking of building a smart candle system for a while; Hackster's ""Alexa and Arduino Smart Home Challenge"" seemed like a good reason to take my ideas and attempt to build something.. One of the interesting aspects of the contest was the notion of taking a idea ""from project to product"". Using that as my guiding principle, I chose components and a final design based on the following factors:. After heavy consideration, I landed on a solution that leveraged an Arduino Pro Mini, ESP8266 (S-12 module), Mongoose OS, and AWS IoT (more details in the appendix).. The main interaction model, using Alexa to provide voice control, is as follows:. Once I landed on a design, I started work on a prototype, with the following requirements:. Flame and Candles. I used yellow LEDs to simulate a flame (leveraging PWM pins to randomly vary the voltage to the LED, which causes the LED to ""flicker""). . I drilled 5/16 in. holes into 2 in. X 4 in. candles and inserted the LEDs inside to simulate a flame burning.. Wax Melter and Temperature Control. I used an electric heating pad and a ceramic ramekin to meet the scent requirements. . A ds18b20 temperature sensor is used to measure the heating pad temperature.  A transistor is used (along with a PWM pin) in order to control the temperature.. Voltage Challenges. The heating pad needs at least 12V at 1.2A to (a) get hot quickly, (b) get hot enough to melt the wax, (c) deal with heat loss between the pad, insulation tiles, and ceramic ramekin. [See linked datasheet for more info]. The Huzzah can only accept 4-6 V. The Pro Mini can, in theory, take up to 12V input, but that stresses the voltage regulator on the device (I blew out a voltage regulator on one of my test devices).. Ultimately, I used a 5V 1.5A voltage regulator (7805) to get a safe input voltage for the microcontrollers. I used a TIP 120 Darlington Transistor to handle the voltage switching for the heating pad (using a PWM pin to get more precise temperature control).. Wiring Diagram. Notes/Comments:. The Smart Candle uses two microcontrollers to provide fuctionality. In order to build your own, you need to configure an ESP8266 to use Mongoose OS and AWS IoT.. Initial Set-up. Option 1 - Create your own AWS account and your own Alexa Skill. Option 2 - Leverage my Alexa skill. To do this, you will need to . Once you have the AWS CLI configured and have downloaded Mongoose OS:. At this point, your ESP8266 is now configured for use with the AWS IoT cloud. This is necessary in order for the candle to interact with Alexa (using my code below).. Notes/Comments:. The Pro Mini controls the functions of the smart candle. Building this is straight forward. . First, solder headers onto the Pro Mini (Sparkfun has a great getting started guide). From there, upload the code to the Pro Mini (check the code section for the Arduino code).. The wiring is documented in the Fritzing diagram. You can wire up to 5 ""candles"" with the code.. I decided to build a three candle holder for my second prototype. . Step 1 - Prepare the Candles. Step 2 - Create the Physical Candle Holder. I used 3D printing to create the candle holder (see section below for STL files):. Notes/Comments:. Step 3 - Final Soldering and Assembly. Step 3.1 - Solder the micro-controllers to a protoboard. Step 3.2 - Attache the heading pad to the base. Step 3.3 - Assemble the remaining components, but do not solder them to the protoboard yet. Step 3.4 - Assemble the LED holders. Step 3.5 - Assemble, then solder the remaining components to the protoboard. The final build, before adding the candles, looked like so:. Step 3.6 - Add the candles and test with the button. Step 3.7 - Test with Alexa. If you are using an account provided my me, then you will be able to control the device through Alexa. Note - See the next section if you plan to build your own Alexa skill.. An overview of building Alexa Smart Home skills can be found here: https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smarthome/understand-the-smart-home-skill-api.html. If this is your first smart home skill, then I suggest you first read the documentation and create a few ""hello world"" skills. Once you're ready, you can use my code to build your own Alexa Skill to control your smart candle.. The Alexa skill responds to the following directives:. Notes/Comments:. I used Login With Amazon for authentication. You can follow the example here: https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smarthome/authenticate-an-alexa-user-account-linking.html. I am in the process of building a ""Device Cloud"" for the Scent-terrific Smart Candle, so my code uses the user token to authenticate the user and retrieve the user_id. . The user_id is then used to either (a) discover devices or (b) confirm the user_id corresponds to the device_id.. If you are replicating this skill, you can skip some of the complexity and hard-code values instead. I've left the code as-is, with comments to where you can either hard-code or access a ""device cloud"" (a DynamoDB table). .

This is a quick start guide on using the ESP8266 as an IoT device powered by PubNub. . This is a basic demonstration of how to use PubNub to handle the communication between an ESP8266 and any other PubNub enabled device. The ESP8266 is a remarkable little piece of hardware, and works perfectly as the controller for an embedded IoT project. Most projects using this module use an external controller like an Arduino to control it using the serial AT commands, but this is unnecessary. The ESP8266 is a programmable 32 bit MCU and can easily work as a standalone device.I have created a basic library demonstrating how to publish and subscribe to a PubNub channel. This channel can also be published or subscribed to from any other PubNub enabled device in the world. This makes setting up a network of IoT sensors or external actuator nodes incredibly simple! The demo shows how to read a button and blink an LED in accordance to data transmitted on the PubNub channel from a remote source.I also demonstrate how to use the PubNub debug console as well as printing debug information over the serial port. A full description of the project including in-depth instructions is available in the source code repository: https://github.com/Kurt-E-Clothier/pubnub-esp8266.

"I do a lot of work with image processing and need to test cameras / imagers. I am going to create a scalable test platform.. Read up about this project on . I do a lot of work with image processing and need to test cameras / imagers. I am going to create a scalable test platform.. . We have looked at creating image processing solutions previously which used image sensors which used a parallel interface or cameras which used HDMI interfaces. . One common interface for image sensors is MIPI, so let's take a look at how we can build an image processing design on the Zybo Z7 which is capable of using both HDMI input and the MIPI camera interface.. I also want to lay the ground work to be able to create an image processing system that allows me to quickly and easily test cameras and sensors. As such a future upgrade to this project will be to support a parallel Pmod camera as well.  . We will then be able to select between which imager we wish to use for out algorithm. This has the added advantage that with pin out on the Zybo MIPI connector has been aligned with other commonly used maker cameras for example the Pi Cameras. We will look at how we can use the Pi camera in another project. . MIPI is the commonly used abbreviation for the Mobile Industry Processor Interface. This is an interface which is designed for uni-directional data transfer at high bandwidths using a number of high speed serial lanes.. MIPI has a number of different layers just like the OSI model, for this application we will be using the MIPI DPhy for the physical layer and MIPI Camera Serial Interface issue 2 (CSI-2) for the protocol which transfers the image data. . If you want to know more about MIPI have a look at this previous installment of the MicroZed Chronicles on MIPI. The Zybo Z7 interfaces with a MIPI camera using a Flat Flexible Cable (FFC) with a pin out as below. Using this interface we can use up to two MIPI lanes for image transfer. Configuration of the imager is provided using a I2C connection, while there are two GPIO provided. . These GPIOs provide different fucntionality depending upon what camera we are connected too. In the case of the PCam we only need to use GPIO on pin 11 this drives the power up signal to the imager.. In some applications we may need to provide a clock however, for the PCam we do not need too as the PCam board contains its own 12 MHz oscillator.. The actual pin out is as below. . As the Zynq 7000 does not have DPhy capable IO, the designers of the Zybo Z7 have implemented a Dphy compatible approach which uses an external resistor network to provide the high speed and low speed MIPI interfaces. . . Our FPGA design is going to have two video inputs paths and a common video output path. . Internally our FPGA architecture will use the following blocks from the Digilent Vivado Library.. From the Vivado Library we will be using the following blocks. We also need to configure the Zynq PS to provide the following. When it comes to clocking the AXI Lite network is clocked at 50 Mhz, the AXI Streaming network and the DPhy reference is connected to 200 MHz. While the Dynamic clock generator reference is connected to the 100 MHz clock. . To aid the integration and testing of the interfaces I placed several integrated logic analyzers within the design. Below you can see the initial capture of the MIPI input. . As we have two inputs we need to ensure both input paths work correctly as we desire.. . . Floor plan of the completed design. . Once we have the FPGA design completed we need to write application SW to configure the image processing cores within the FPGA and configure the PCam for the correct operation. . Both cameras HDMI and MIPI will be configured to operate with a 720p resolution. . The application SW therefore needs to perform the following . The largest part of the SW application is in configuration the PCam over the I2C link. The data sheet is quite comprehensive however the first thing we need to do is ensure we can communicate with the PCam. . I do this by reading the register 0x3100 and ensuring the response is 0x78 which is the I2C address of the device. IF I do not receive that value then I declare the camera is not connected, provided the camera is connected the next stage is to initialize the camera and then configure the camera for the mode we desire to operate in. . Once I had worked out what we need to configure in the PCam I created, a simple function which would read through an array and output the configuration data to the PCam. . The software allows me to switch between the different input sources using the AXIS Switch.. When I put all this together and ran the application on my bench it seemed to work pretty well providing me with a flexible platform for future testing of cameras and image sensors. . . . With the software all written we can use both video input formats. We will also be able to see differences in the performance. . I intend to come back to this board in a future MicroZed chronicles blog and add in support for Pmod camera and expand the MIPI camera to work with the PI low light camera. Over the next few weeks and months but at the moment it is good sufficient for the testing I have in mind, and provides a very flexible platform.  .

"The project I want to share with you today is an Arduino maze game, which became a pocket console as capable as Arduboy!. Read up about this project on . The project I want to share with you today is an Arduino maze game, which became a pocket console as capable as Arduboy!. Welcome to my first tutorial!. The project I want to share with you today is Arduino maze game, which became a pocket console as capable as Arduboy and similar Arduino based consoles. It can be flashed with my (or your) future games thanks to exposed ICSP header.. I had an idea few months ago to build a maze game on Arduino, but without hard-coded set of mazes. It should be able to generate a new maze for each level you are playing, so you never see the same maze again :). Coding this was a bit of a challenge, since Arduino is limited in RAM memory, and then I found few examples how this can be done with simple Bo-Taoshi algorithm.. Code I used as a starting point I took by SANUKI UDON and his project HOW TO MAKE A MAZE GENERATOR USING ATTINY13A. My starting point was with a small breadboard with only 4 buttons connected to move through maze, but later when I decided it should be a game console I added a few more buttons. On larger breadboard you can see 2 more buttons, and later I added a third one to be used as start/pause/menu button. Connecting components as shown in diagram above.. Buttons:. SSD1306 OLED screen:. Buzzer:. A-Maze game source code can be found here: https://github.com/alojzjakob/A-Maze. Open in Arduino IDE and upload to your board or use ISP programmer to program your chip.. I recommend using USBTIny ISP, never had problems with it :) but you can also use ordinary Arduino to program your chip.. In my case I did not use external crystal, so my Atmega328p chip works on internal oscillator which is 8MhZ.. For more info visit this link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoToBreadboard.. If you want to make this project permanent, with a nice looking case, here is the simple 3D printable case I designed: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2851100. In the pictures above you can see how all components are laid out on the 4x6 prototype PCB.. Most button wiring goes under the battery holders, try to make it as plain as possible, so battery holders can have relatively flush fit above the board with wires inbetween.. I also recommend do other wiring under the screen, since Atmega chip legs are soldered and exposed under the screen. When you are done soldering, put some insulation tape under the screen to prevent shorts etc.. ICSP header is optional, and if you decide not to expose it, it will make your assembly much easier, 6 connections less to take care of, but program the chip first before you solder it, or use 28 pin DIP socket so you can easily remove the chip for programming.. .

"A pantry which can automatically replenish kitchen items.. Read up about this project on . A pantry which can automatically replenish kitchen items.. Most of the times, when I want to cook something I find some cooking ingredient (onion, garlic, chili etc.) is running low. In some cases I buy wrong item such as garlic instead of onion. When I reach at my kitchen I observe that, I have a plenty of onion but no garlic. How will you feel in such a situation?. To get rid from such situation I built a Smart Pantry which can order automatically    to replenish every ingredients of my pantry with Amazon DRS. Busy life, easy solution!!!. Here, I will show you how I made such hi-tech pantry and I hope you will able to reproduce it as your requirement.. So, let's get started. First I will explain how I prepared my pantry to sense the shortage of any ingredient. I used Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) to detect the absence of ingredient in a specific box of the pantry. Arduino UNO is used to to read the sensor value.    . I took a 3 compartment kitchen box for my demo project and it can house three different ingredients into it's three separate box. For sensing the shortage of ingredients in a box I am measuring weight of each box with force sensitive resistor. Though FSR is not very accurate for weight measurement but enough for this project for identifying a blank box.. Photos attached above shows how I placed fsr in the box. I placed one fsr below each compartment and tried to put it at the center of the compartment. Using mini drill I made two holes for every sensor to bring out the pin of the sensor out of the box. Then I soldered jumper wire to each pin of the sensors to connect it with Arduino.. Three sensors are used for three separate parts of the box and sensors are placed in the center of each box. . Force sensitive resistor change its value when a force is applied to it. Pressure from a hard surface is not good for FSR and you will not get accurate result. For better output I place a small piece of foam on the bottom of every inner box using double sided tape. Place it in such position that it exactly be on the sensor.. Our pantry is ready!!!.

"Cellular backdoor with Hologram Nova on Raspberry Pi flask-ask server-Amazon Alexa controlled.. Read up about this project on . Cellular backdoor with Hologram Nova on Raspberry Pi flask-ask server-Amazon Alexa controlled.. Our previous project with the ARDrone 2.0 helped us learn about a new project. Our current Alexa and Arduino Smart Home Challenge entry introduced us to the skills needed to create a working demo for a voice-controlled drone.. Here is what we came up with:. Below, we outline our process.. To set up the Pi with the necessary software, install flask-ask:. You'll also need the library that controls the ARDrone via WiFi. Clone this repo and run the install.sh script provided.. We created a skill that was linked to a server running off the raspberry pi. Flask is an easy to use python library to serve an application. Using flask-ask, we can configure the server to communicate with our Alexa skill. We use Ngrok to serve the application externally and gives us an https link we'll need for our Alexa skill. Here's a snippet of code for the application. The full app.py script will be attached below.. To run this application, just type:. For this project, we used ngrok to serve the application over https. We used a reserved subdomain name so the link can be consistent with the Amazon Alexa skill configuration. To serve the application, run:. Because the Raspberry Pi joins the ARDrone's WiFi access point, we use the Hologram Nova USB modem as a cellular backdoor enabling Alexa to communicate with the flask-ask server.. We found that the application worked smoothly using hologram nova with a monthly data plan of 250mb. You can set this up using the hologram dashboard and activating a sim card.. Setting up the Alexa skill, navigate to the Amazon developer dashboard and log in. Click on Alexa and get started with Alexa Skill kit. Then create a new skill by clicking Add a new skill. Start completing the tabs on the left following their instructions. . Follow the instructions given by the gui.. Finish filling out the last two tabs until all the check marks are green. Then launch your skill with the beta testing feature. This allows you to host your skill on any echo device before publishing it. Follow the instructions on the email link to install the skill on your Echo device.. To run the entire application, first make sure your drone is on and its wifi connecting is up. On the Raspberry Pi server, connect to your ARDrone's network. In the terminal, connect to Hologram's network running the following command:. Once the blue LED on the Nova is solid and this process has finished, you are on the cellular network. On a separate tab, run the ngrok command we mentioned earlier:. Finally, in another tab, run the application. If the drone's lights are green, you're good to fly. If not, ask Alexa to reset it by saying, ""Alexa, ask MajorTom to reset."" . Now try to command your drone to fly! Say, ""Alexa, ask MajorTom to blast off."". 🎶 I think my spaceship knows which way to go 🎶 . kindbot.io . "
