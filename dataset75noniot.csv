"My favourite memory from fourth grade was a day that my class went to a nature reserve. The conservationists told me to grab some birdseed and hold it out in front of myself. All of a sudden, a bird landed in my hand and proceeded to eat some of my seeds. I was very surprised because at that point in my life I had never been so close to a bird before. Looking at them up close, they're very exotic and interesting animals, but as quickly as it came, it was gone. And I was hooked.. . Sadly every year, birds are ingesting the plastic that we humans deposit into their habitats. The birds regularly confuse these plastics for food and eat it. They also feed this plastic to their chicks. This project aims to help out the birds a little. Rather than allowing plastics to find themselves in landfills, we are going to make a recycled plastic bird feeder.. . My design is great for people without a lot of tools and/or skills. This is also a great home-school project for kids to do. Kids enjoy feeding the birds (which you can learn to do at the end). This is also a great way for them to learn some environmental stewardship.. Let's get started!. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. For this project you will need:. For this step, you will only need your smaller drill bit:. Drill four or five holes in parallel lines as shown in the picture in red. . Attach your larger bit to your drill and drill the two holes marked once again in red. Make sure that the holes are pretty much opposite to each other. These will be the holes for hanging your feeder. . Drill a hole at the end of both sticks. Drill a couple more holes along the center. While doing this be careful not to snap the popsicle stick in half. Try to only drill about five holes per stick.. You may be wondering why you have been drilling so many holes in odd places. Wonder no longer! These holes are for a technique that I call glue-filling. . The steps of how to glue-fill are as follows:. Glue-filling will help the glue permanently hold parts together. You will not be just utilizing the adhesion of the glue but the hardness of it as well. On my first feeder, I didn't glue-fill and after a couple of days, it broke.. Glue-fill all of the small holes in the lid. Try to join the fill for extra strength as shown in the picture. . Glue-fill the popsicle stick holes. . Put some fresh hot-glue over the glue-fill to glue the lid to the popsicle sticks. The sections of glue-fill should be touching. Try to move the popsicles sticks so they are parallel and centred on the lid.. This part is a little complicated so I broke it up into more manageable parts:. With your small drill bit again drill five holes it the bottom of your lid. These will let rainwater escape from the seed basin to prevent mold.. Even more glue-filling, I hope that you aren't bored of it yet. This will the last time, I promise. This time you will need to be careful of some things though:. Now for the moment you have all been waiting for! This part you only get one chance at so double-check everything before you move on. Look back at the picture a couple of times as this will help with the positioning.. Does everything look good? Great, follow these steps:. Put some glue on top of where filling it on the container. Now, align the fill in the cap to the container's fill and press down to glue them together.. To make the feeder hang better, tie an overhand loop in the center of the string. This also makes the feeder look nicer.. The whole purpose of this feeder was to hold food, right? I personally like to use black oil sunflower seeds, so my design (this one) works with those. You should be able to use any kind of seed, theoretically. Please let me know what kind you use in the comments. . I fill about 1/3 of the container before hanging it the first time, just in case it falls down for whatever reason. This will fill to almost the top with no problems, so really it is up to you how much to put in.. You will need to flip the feeder over right before you hang it, otherwise, it is probably better to leave it upside down.. When you do need to flip it follow these steps:. Before you hang your feeder, you should probably think about where it will go. Birds enjoy the security of being near a tree or tall bush to quickly hide from predators. Another thing to think about while hanging it is squirrels. Where I live they are a big problem. As an attempt to deter squirrels I give my feeders a sphere of at least 2.5m(8ft) in diameter of clear space. this way squirrels can't leap onto my feeders from other branches or the ground. I also like to put my feeders in places that I will see from inside of my house. . To hang your feeder, you will need to:. Once you have birds coming to your feeder often, (which shouldn't take long depending on where you live) you will be able to hand-feed birds. This is an amazing thing to do with kids and is a very rewarding and fun activity. What are you waiting for?. I hope that you have enjoyed the process of creating your own recycled bird feeder. I also hope that this has brightened up your isolation period as much as it did mine. If you have any suggestions to improve my design, that would be awesome! . If you liked this project and want to show your appreciation, voting me in the trash to treasure contest would really help me out. Thanks!. Participated in the Trash to Treasure Contest."
"How to upcycle a coffee can into a chic birdhouse. . Easy to make with hand tools and a few dollars in materials.. The most expensive part is probably the coffee that was originally in the can.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. These plans are adjustable to based on the coffee can you have. I used a standard 10 oz foil can.. You need the energy and you need to empty the coffee can anyways.. I made my birdhouse out of rough cedar that I purchased at Menards.. Any big box store would have similar materials.. You will need the following:. This project is easily completed with hand tools. Power tools make things faster but not always safer if you are doing this with a little helper.Tools needed:. Cut your boards to the sizes shown above.. You will need two pieces 4-1/4"" x 4-1/4"" square for the end panels.. Since our boards were 5-1/2"" wide, this will be the width of the widest roof panel. . The other one will be cut to 4-3/4"" to give us a 1/2"" roof overhang.. The length of the roof panels is adjustable based on the size of your coffee can.. Measure your coffee can then add 1-1/2"" for each end or 3"" total to the length of the roof panels.. After cutting, you might want to hit all the edges with some sandpaper to avoid nasty splinters.. Measure in 1-1/2"" from each end of the roof panels to mark where the end panels will be. . This will aid in assembly and nailing the birdhouse together later.. Use a rule and a square to mark your lines. . I know this is a birdhouse, but you can practice good layout skills even on a birdhouse. Use the narrow roof panel to layout where the glue and nails will go on the wider panel.. Pre-drill the nail holes with a 1/8"" twist drill. This is not necessary, but this will keep wood from splitting.. In this photo, you can see where I marked the layout for the end panels.. Glue and nail the roof together.. I used three nails here.. Here you can see how things will go together. . Notice the roof is now symmetrical and there is an even overhang on both sides.. This was designed as a wren house.. Draw an X from corner to corner and mark the center for the hole.. Use a 1-1/8"" spade bit to drill a through hole in one end panel.. If you want to make this for another type of bird, you will need to research what size hole you need.. Do not make the hole too large or you will get pests (eg. sparrows) living in you birdhouse.. Make sure your measurements and layout are still correct.. This is the last time to make adjustments.. Apply a bit of glue and assemble the end panels.. Use your layout lines to help you get these in the right place.. Pre-drill four nail holes (2 each side of roof) and assemble with 6d galvanized finish nails.. Take your time and check your alignment as you go.. Offset the nails slightly to avoid hitting another nail.. Use a few clamps or a helper if you need to while assembling the birdhouse.. Sometimes the parts like to move around too much while nailing.. Sometimes the nails will have a mind of their own.. This happens even when you are trying to be careful.. Take your time and tap or pull the nails out and try again.. I goofed on my layout lines. I just moved the nail holes over a bit and re-nailed things together.. The birds will never know the difference.. Maybe you can offer to discount the rent.. Use a 1/4"" dowel rod to hold the coffee can and the wood together.. Layout and drill a hole for dowel. I placed mine about 1/2"" in from the corner.. I ended up using a 9/32"" drill bit. The 1/4"" hole was too tight.. You will want the dowel to be secure, but you also need to able to remove it for cleaning and maintenance.. Drill a hole in both end panels.. Most people think a birdhouse needs a perch.. Have you ever seen a tree with a perch?. Birds will know how to get in and out of the birdhouse.. Sometimes the perch makes it too easy for predators to get to the eggs.. Trim it flush with the front of the house.. . I twisted two screw eyes about 1"" in from each end of the roof.. Pre-drilling will make this easier, but this is not necessary.. Use a pair of pliers or a nail to help screw these into the wood.. When the eyes are in, you are done!. Go outside and look for great places to hang your new birdhouse.. Congratulations on your project.. These are the screw eyes I used.. This pack cost me about $1.25 at Menards.. If you wanted to make this house last longer, I would use stainless steel hardware.. Here is another birdhouse I made using plastic canister from another brand of coffee.. Adjust the length of your roof panels to accommodate the difference in size of canisters.."
"Build your own WiFi-Camera-enabled Bird Box, cheaply, and quickly. Perfect for an After-School/Club/Scouts project or a weekend DIY build. Watch birds build nests, raise young, and before long - the young fly leave the nest!. Although camera kits do exist for bird boxes, they have a few limitations - they are usually wired (i.e. not WiFi) and if they are, they are at least 2-3x more expensive than this - and don't 'scale up' effectively: You have to have one camera to one next box, it'll cost a fortune, if you wanted to observe multiple boxes. (With that said, if you do still want to install permanent 1:1 camera:box, then this is still much cheaper! (see Appendix 1)). . This 'bird cam variation' uses 3ml Syringe Tubes to create nifty little rainproof 'spy holes' to insert a WiFi endoscope in/out of, with minimal disruption to the nesting birds. The pictures and video can be viewed on any smartphone.. Endoscopes are used to inspect drains, under floors, doing car repairs - you name it. Consequently, they are made at higher volume than bird cams, and hence are cheaper (and arguably much more compact). Indeed, once the season is over / when not in use, you still have a useful device. So I think this is an effective way to get started, and if you really become obsessed, sure - upgrade to the fancy kit ;o). PS - Images are not from me. I'm just at the start of the season, and will update when I get pics.... Essentials:. Bird Box (x4 bargain): https://amzn.to/3cbFc30(Can get larger bulk quantities for Schools, but 4 seems a good starter pack!). WiFi Endoscope: https://amzn.to/2VgWupq(One endoscope can be taken round multiple boxes, where accessible).. Drill: https://amzn.to/2VfQAEJ (in case interested).. 3ml Syringes: https://amzn.to/3bXPkfH (suggested size).. 10mm Drill Bit: https://amzn.to/37WzKxj (suggested size).. Mini FIles: https://amzn.to/2VhyK4u . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. The Box shown is a fair price (around £3.5/box). It's hard to argue with this, when you consider you'd have to buy screws, hinges, paint, nails, and drill and assemble. So I really think that this is a good starter project - especially for schools, where many kids want to have a go, you can buy a large quantity to install in a number of locations.. However, if you really want to make one from scratch, this looks good:https://www.rspb.org.uk/fun-and-learning/for-famil.... I 'upgraded' this bird box with some dowel on the front, so birds could perch and check it out. I'm not sure how much this improves the chances of nesting, but it'd seem plausible to want to not fly into a hole without looking, right? We shall see.... I used a 3ml syringe, which has a 10mm OD and 8mm ID. . The camera has an OD of 7.75mm so fits nicely into the tube. It's coincidence, but works a treat.. Cut in two, around the '2.5ml' region - or - [10mm + the thickness of your bird box wood walls].. If you find it a bit tight, give it a stretch with some pliers. . I 'hovered' the camera in the approximate middle to check the alignment. This turned out to be 4.5mm from the back of the (roof) of the bird box, and naturally dead-centre. . Taking a 10mm drill bit, I drilled the hole. Note: first I drilled perpendicular to the roof, and then once 'established', I manoeuvred the drill to be vertical from the floor of the bird box. . Lastly, I gave the drill a slight 'wiggle' to allow a not too tight fit. . I inserted the Syringe piece from underneath, as shown.. I removed the 'collar' of the camera (this is a screw fitting for other attachments, not needed here), to give easy passage in the tube. If it is tight, use a small file, or a bit of studding to free up the hole.. Follow the instructions on the endoscope to get images, as above.. ---. Safe to say, rotating the camera to get a good angle is easy.. But do pay attention to the angle (x and y axis), and gently twist the syringe into the best position. . Don't glue it yet, but get happy with the set-up. . I realised if I made a 'viewing port', I'd need to create a reliable water-tight bung, that was still easy to remove. This might sound easy, but I can assure you from my time as an engineer at Dyson, that rubber seals are not trivial. So why 'reinvent the wheel' when there was a great one in the Syringe. Indeed, this was the initial inspiration, and as it fit the endoscope - it seemed to lucky to just ignore, so I wrote up the Instructable!! . Anyway, using a scalpel or pliers, cut the plunger in half, and re-insert the seal end into the syringe to stop water dripping on your chicks when not viewing with the camera.. So with my rubber ducky mounted on some blocks to what I anticipated to be the next height, I checked the camera function, focus, etc. I was very impressed, and as you can see the focal point is good. . Now you have the syringe 'camera mount' all set, carefully remove the camera.. Take some superglue and fix in place. If you have a lot of space that needs 'filling', use some woodglue, or even Sugru, as shown. Indeed, a pack of Sugru is rather expensive for one project, but I reckon one single pack of it would have done easily 10 seals here. . Adhesives:. Sugru (optional): https://amzn.to/2T4MEEe . Wood Glue (optional): https://amzn.to/2Vg2ajq . Mini Super Glue (bargain!): https://amzn.to/2Vg2ajq (recommended to get). . Double Bubble Epoxy (not essential): https://amzn.to/2Vg2ajq . I bit of an optional extra, but I like that this drilled-out twig looks nice, but is a secondary barrier to the elements.. Follow steps as shown, and be aware to cut slight angles, to match the slope of the roof, and also to keep rain off the top of the chimney/stick. . For c.£4 per box, one can get going with making quite a few of these!. My son and I were very pleased with these, and we'll look froward to installing these around the garden/trees/shed/etc. to see what works best.. Wish us luck!. OK - so forgive the earnestness here, but I'll be back with some real images in due course.. I'm not a fan of posting if I have not tested fully, but given this design is based on existing RSPB bird boxes, it really has no reason to perform less well than other successful alternatives. Safe to say one must take care not to disturb the birds once established, and if you're unsure, then perhaps installing the WiFi cam permanently might not be a bad idea. . Not only is the Endoscope WiFi Cam cheaper, but even if you use it 1:1 ratio, it will allow you to learn the best viewing angles for each species, etc. I will post more as I learn more =D. Although I've suggested keeping this setup as a high ratio of [experimental] bird boxes, and 1 camera, you can of course install the system 1 cam : 1 box, as a permanent setup. . To do this you'd need to place the WiFi transmitter in a waterproof enclosure. Sometimes called an 'IP rated' enclosure, these are commonly sold for all manner of electronics that need to survive the elements outdoors. . Luckily the endoscope cable (i.e. not unit) is waterproof, so this can be left exposed. However, the electronic 'box' and the USB connection should be placed inside. Care should be taken to ensure that the USB power supply wire is kept dry at the side being plugged in. . When working with main electricity (even when 'safe' at the USB side) care should be taken to ensure the installation is safe. If in doubt, consult an electrician or other qualified person. . For example: Enclosure: https://amzn.to/32n9viwUSB Charger: https://amzn.to/2PjDnar. You can buy a timer switch if you are the forgetful type! Timer: https://amzn.to/3a67H07. I realised I had some Syringe Tube left over. I was going to chuck this in the trash, when I realise that it might well be put to good use to create more viewing holes.... ...I set about installing them at different heights, vertically, but also horizontally too. . I've seen a few camera bird boxes, and it seems that one issue is that if the camera has poor low-light management, then the images are dim/poor quality. . Having just been playing around with vacuum forming in HDPE, from recycled Milk Jugs, I realised I could make a nice 'opaque' window from this. I used a heat gun for quickness, as the form was simple. Steps as shown. . I should say upfront, I'm very sceptical about the various advertised bird boxes that claim to be able to stick with suction-cups to windows, and be able to be viewed from inside. . Firstly, I think the suction cups will not cope with changes in moisture, heat, cold, etc. - and will likely fall off, which would be a real shame if there were eggs/young killed in the process. . Secondly, I suspect that if mounted to a 'busy' window, this will freak out the birds. I didn't see any convincing reviews or videos of people with actual birds nesting. My hunch is that it needs to be covered up most of the time - hence I chose a window I have in my shed, which the blind is usually down. Do hopefully this will work. We shall see..... If you have any tips, pictures - please post below.. If you have a school or are a teacher, do ask if anything is unclear - I intend to do this at my local nursery/afterschool facility, so hence trying to keep costs down..

 . Love the concept. Thanks for sharing. Would like to do something similar with a couple of the bird houses we've scattered about - BUT, I do not have a Cell Phone! I have Internet and a router and Wi-Fi, Chromecast and (Win7 / Win10 laptop(s) and would like to find a WIRELESS Borescope thing that I could connect to as I do my HP Wireless printer.So, Is there such a thing? Or ""an app for that?""One other question on the chance that you've done more research than I accomplished last night: Is your device one that uses a fiber optic cable?Anyone?.

 . Hi. Thanks for the kind words. Glad you like it =)Sadly, I personally didn't find 'an App for that', as even most Emulators don't likely work with something like this (or unless you're a coder are tricky). X-Code et al. I think you're asking for a WPS function on this scope, but it seems unlikely as this is a next level of 'smarts', but I could be wrong, but nothing in the description that suggests otherwise.~ If I were in your shoes, assuming you're game for $40 to make this, you can honestly pick up an unlocked second hard Android phone for probably $50 on Amazon or eBay. the DEPSTECH software needs nothing fancy to fun it. So I'd consider that perhaps? You don't even need a SIM card. Hope that's helpful..

 . Love what you've done -- but had an idea on how it could be taken a bit further. You wouldn't need to send in a camera probe to get results or ever disturb the birds.But how about a very inexpensive micro-board with camera and a solar panel on the roof? It could wake up every so often take a photo. And then once a day it could upload all the photos over wifi.Micro: ESP32-camSolar arrays to support battery typebattery under protective housing.

 . Hi Capt!Thanks for the message. I'll fess-up and say I'm no coder (no shock, huh!), so this project was part borne out of my lack of ability, but also an awareness that there are many people who'd want to use cameras but also are not 'techy'. It's pretty much plug-n-play! That said, it is certainly on my radar to do a PIR sensor update (but it'll be more expensive but essential for situations like monitoring Hedgehogs, etc. - which need a 'trigger'), so I'll put it to be folks I'm working with to look at the ESP32. So, thanks for that =)J.

 . Some sort of opaque window in the roof would work well to provide light recording but allow the birds darkness to sleep..

 . I put mine on the side, and I'm hoping it's enough, but I worried that it'd leak on the top, as it's harder to do a seal that way. But I'm open to suggestions. And indeed, if birds dislike skylights, and prefer sidelights. Complex animals, huh! xD.

 . I love this project since I've built a few birdhouses in my days as a Boy Scout & now. I have one suggestion/tip. Make the back panel longer than the house itself. The extra wood extending beyond the bottom of the house makes for easier and more secure mounting. A house hanging from a nail will eventually fall. You can also have the panel extend above as well, but you have to modify your hinged roof. Another option is a hinged front that swings out from the top. .

 . I think I got lucky with this particular birdbox - as cheap as it is, it has a brass 'keyhole', and I mounted it on a 2inch screw, so I'm hoping that'd do it. But taking your point seriously, I do think a backboard is a good suggestion, and given the storms of late, I'm inclined to reinforce actually, before anything sets up nest. Nice idea with the 'side flip' roof...will have a think at how to do this for V2.0! Thanks..

 . This is a fantastic concept and project! The next step would be to modify it with a motion sensor that could detect when a bird enters or exits the box and give it a stand-alone power source. I'm thinking of an application where a the scope stays attached to a single box and off in a tree and one might walk within wifi range and simply use the phone's app to see what's going on. This is beyond my talents but it's cool to think about..

 . That's a great call :o) I guess I've been aware that I could do some fancy Raspberry Pi stuff, but of course it requires some knowledge of coding. This project is certainly more 'low entry' on skill level, intentionally. That said, I'd be up for finding a simpler hack....so here's hoping Instructables community might have some ideas! There is a very comprehensive one I mentioned, but it's very very advanced tbh. So something in-between is needed. Hmmm. Any thoughts - please share!.

 . The biggest advantage would be infrared LED which the birds can not see. I am thinking about doing this for owl boxes so 24/7 daylight might be an issue. Be sure to get the ones that will allow the the IR LEDS to stay on with exterior power. The other issue is supplying power. While power cables are cheaper than video cable ( not much) since you need to supply power ( for constant use) might as well use a wired camera. This is a great project, I am just tweaking it to my personal need. Here is an IR borescope but not wifi https://www.overstock.com/Electronics/SpyTec-16ft-USB-Borescope-Endoscope-Inspection-Camera-w-IR-LEDs-for-Night-Vision/14585391/product.html.

 . So I've not tested this, but it seems around £28 (inc postage in UK). https://amzn.to/2I2ieNS True, tiny 10-buck spy cams do exist, but often get warm quickly - I was keen to put as much of the electronics away from the birds as possible. I might be worrying unnecessarily, but until I know better <<please comment if you do>> I'm trying to minimise disturbance to birds. Thanks for comment tho - got me thinking! .

 . Thanks... I'm going to try this. Although I'm no birdhouse expert, I have read in more places than one that the perch on the outside is totally unnecessary and even a hazard as it gives predators like raccoons, squirrels, etc. a perch to hang on to while burglarizing the nest. I've made a point to watch the birds around here and none of them seem to have a problem perching on the entry hole while investigating their future home. .

 . Some species of birds require the perch, for others they do not want the perch.You can use that to select the kind of bird that you want in the bird house.You will have to do some research to find out their preference.. © 2020 Autodesk, Inc.."
"Building a birdhouse can be a difficult, yet rewarding task. There are many different types of birds, which is why there are so many different types of birdhouses that you can make. As by reading the title, the birdhouse that we will be giving you instructions on how to make is a bluebird birdhouse. It can be difficult, but as you work on it, it gets easier, because you will be repeating many steps and using the same measurements. Since it is hard to explain how to build something with only words and no pictures, or no words and only pictures, I have created this instructable to help you build your birdhouse.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Before you start the project, you are going to want to gather the following materials and tools:. -Materials Needed:. -Tools Needed:. -Extra Notes:. . After you have gathered all of the materials and tools you need, it is time to begin the actual constructional process. First thing you need to do is measure 10 3/8"" from the start of the 4' board. Line it up carefully at the saw, and cut on the line. Set the piece you just cut out aside, and make another measurement at 10 3/8"" on the long board and cut it out. You should now have 2, 10 3/8"" pieces out of the 4' board. The two pieces will be for your left and right sides of the birdhouse. The only special thing that needs to be done with the sides is that you need to cut the top at an angle. I will include pictures, but basically what we did is we had the wood vertically in front of us, so we could see the flat side, and measured 10 degrees down from the top on the left side for the right wall, and the right side for the left wall. This way, the smooth side can be out on each side. After marking the 10 degree space, cut from the opposite corner down to the 10 degree mark. Make sure that when you cut it, you don't trim any of the top, because you do not want to change the length. I have included pictures to help you understand.. To cut out the piece that will be the front of the birdhouse, you want to start by measuring 9 1/2"", then cut that piece out. The front will have features that are for this birdhouse. First, take the piece you have just cut out, and measure 7 1/4"" up from the bottom. Make a mark on that spot, then find the halfway point across, so it intersects with the mark you made from the bottom. now, take your 1 1/2"" hole saw, and center it where the two marks meet, and drill the center hole. This is where the birds will enter. After you drilled the hole all the way through, measure 1/2"", and use your square to make a line all the way to each end. Then measure another 1/4"" down from that one, and another from that line. You should now have three lines, each spaced 1/4"" from each other and the 1/2"" down from the hole. We used the sliding square to help keep the saw straight. You made the lines so the birds could grip to the house, and this is better than putting a peg in, because predators can grab onto the peg and reach into the house. Next, you are going to want to change your saw angle to 10 degrees, and bevel the edge from the top. You want to make it so it is slanted down towards you. Make sure that when you bevel the edge, that you don't cut any of the length down. You are going to want your smooth side up, so when you bevel the edge, it is the right way when assembly time comes.. The bottom has many unique features that will all be covered in this section. First order of business, you want to measure 4"" from the 4' board. Then, you want to measure 1/4"" away from each side of every corner. Then, you can draw a line from each mark on the corners, or you can just cut across. Sand the edges to make each corner rounded. Doing this creates little spaces where air can flow through, and any water that gathers in the house can drain out.. After cutting out all of your sides of the birdhouse, you should have a piece of wood that is approximately 1' 1 3/8"", or 13 3/8"". The only thing that you need to do with the back piece is bevel the top part, just like you did to the front. When you bevel the back piece, you will need the rough part of the wood facing up, unlike the front piece, where it was facing up. If you don't have a rough and a smooth side, you just need to make sure that you have your beveled edges going the right way. You want the wood to be slanted the same way, towards you. After you having finished beveling the back part, it's time to measure and cut the roof.. Now that you have used up your 4' board, you will need your second piece of wood. It needs to be 1 x 8, so 1extra inch are allowed on both the left and right sides of the house. The board should be 10 1/2"" long, and 9 1/4"" wide, so the board shouldn't need to be cut. Before you move on to the step, check and make sure that the roof ends are squared. The main part for the roof is when you are going to attach it to the rest of the birdhouse.. After you have fully cut your pieces, it is time to assemble your birdhouse. There is a certain way that we attached the sides, which made it a lot less difficult to put together. First, we started by attaching the right side to the back piece. The measurement we used most is 3/8"", which is half the thickness of the board. When you first place the right side on the back, you want to mark 1/8"" down from where you beveled the edge. It should be 1/8"" down from the bottom of the bevel. We put the right side on that mark, and clamped it to the back. We measured down 2"" from the top where the right side meets the back, and 3/8"" in from the left side of the back. Then we measured 2"" up from where the right side meets the back on the bottom, and 3/8"" in from the left side. Make sure that your measurements are all on the back side of the birdhouse. Pre-drill the hole, so the wood doesn't split, and then drill the screw in. Do that to each meeting point. That is how to attach the right side.. After you successfully attached the right side to the back piece, it's time to attach the bottom. First, you want to look at you right side piece, and make a mark 1/8"" up from the bottom. You are going to put the bottom edge of the bottom piece on that line. We clamped the bottom to the right/back piece. Clamps are optional, but they aid in assembly. After clamping the bottom to the assembled piece, we looked at the right side, and measured 1-1/4"" from the left side of the right piece, and the right side where it meets the back, not starting on the back side. Then, since we pushed the back up 1/8"", you want to measure 1/2"" up from the two points you just made. Now just like before, you pre-drill the hole, then put the screw in. Now that you have the 3 pieces attached, it's time to attach the front.. Lay the front piece on your assembled piece so it is flush (even) with the bottom of the right side, and so it lays flush on top of the right side. First, you want to mark 1"" up on the face from the right side, and 3/8"" from the edge. Now, measure 1"" down from where the beveled section ends, and 3/8"" in, so it's in line with the bottom screw. Pre-drill and then drill in the screw. Now, find the middle of the front piece, and mark it on the bottom. From that point, measure 1/2"" up, so the screw goes into the middle of the back. Pre-drill and drill in the screw. Now that you have fully attached the front, it is now time to put the left side on. . This side will be the most difficult, because it will be a swinging door, which allows you to open up the bird house and clean it out. First, you can make a reference line using your square and a pencil, make a line from the middle of your screw to the other side. Doing this makes it easier to make the screws aligned. Make a mark 3/8"" in from the left side on the front face, where your reference line is. You can now pre-drill and drill in the screw. When you pre-drill, make it just a little bit deeper, so your side can swing and the screw can be tight. If you want to make it easier, make a reference line going down across the left side, then 3/8"" onto the back. The screw for the left sides that are on the front and the back must be in line with each other, otherwise the left side won't swing. These screws act as the hinge.Pre-drill, and drill in the screw. Test and make sure that the left side swings. Now, to keep it from swinging open, make a reference line just like before, but on the bottom. Make a mark 3/8"" in from the reference line you just made, and pre-drill a little deeper, just like the other left side screws. This screw keeps it in place. If you want to open the left side, take out the bottom screw on the left, so you can open it. Now, we move on to attaching the final piece, the roof.. Since you beveled the edges, the roof will be attached at a slant. First, with the birdhouse laying front side up, lay the roof down, so it's flush with the beveled edges and sits on the table. This is the easiest way to attach the roof. Now, you want to center the roof, so there is an equal amount of overhang on the left and right sides (it is good to make marks with a pencil after it is centered, so you don't lose the correct placement). If you want, you can clamp it down so you don't lose your placement. We marked 1 3/4"" from each of the edges on the top, then 3/8"" from the back edge. Both of these will be along the back edge. After your measurements are correct, pre-drill and drill in the screw. Now, you only need to do two more screws. Now, you want to measure approximately 6 5/8"" from the back edge, so if you were to draw a line down, it goes through the first screw on the top. After you have your mark 6-5/8"" down and 1 3/4"" in from both sides, you can pre-drill and drill in the screws for the final time. Now you're almost done! Just a few things for clean up and finishing touches, and you'll be good to go!. Now, you can take your Orbital Sander, and sand each flat face. After all of the pencil marks are gone, you can take your sheet sandpaper, and run it along the edges, which makes them smooth. Be careful not to get any slivers! And now you are done! You can mount it on a tree or a fence post, close to a source of water. You can drill it into a tree from the access wood on the bottom, and angle a screw in from the top to secure it that way.

"Our local woodworking club has an annual Birdhouse Contest. It's an opportunity for us to try to out-do each other, so we get some crazy entries. I made this Rubik's Cube Birdhouse. I always try to make something that would be funny to see birds using. But, I spend so much time building and decorating them that I just put them on display in my workshop, rather than let the animals and weather destroy them. This one is no different.. Watch my build video, then follow the instructions and pictures in this Instructable to build one yourself!. Supplies: 6-foot 1x10 pine board, wood glue, spraypaint, one 1-1/4"" screw, blue tape, sticker label (optional). Tools: Table Saw, Drill, Drill Bits, Sander, Screwdriver, Clamps, Printer (optional). Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. My birdhouse was made from six 9"" squares with 45-degree bevels on each side. You could certainly build the box using straight cuts and butt joints if you want by adjusting the dimensions of the sides to get a cube.. I tilted the table saw to 45-degrees, then set the fence so that it was 9"" away from the point where the blade exits the board. I cut all four sides to make a square and repeated that 5 more times. I recommend the magnetic Wixey Digital Angle Gauge for getting accurate bevel cuts. First, you zero it on the flat saw table, then stick it on the blade to set the right angle.. I selected one piece for the front of the birdhouse and drilled a 1.5"" hole, which is suitable for bluebirds. We have a lot of those here in the ATL.. Tip! Birds are picky about the size of their birdhouses and holes. Find out what kind of birds are in your area, then look up a birdhouse dimensions chart to find a suitable size house for your birds. Also, birds don't need a perch so ditch the dowel - it will just embarrass them.. I glued the front piece and 3 other pieces together using blue tape for clamping pressure. I made sure the edges were flush and the box was square. After gluing on the top, I added a cross brace across the bottom opening so I would be able to screw on the bottom. I used my trim router to put an 1/8"" roundover on the corners.. Tip! When making a birdhouse, it's a good idea to have a way to open it so you can clean it out.. To make it look like a Rubik's Cube, I set the height of the table saw blade to about 1/4"" and cut some shallow grooves 1/3 of the width into the box. My box was 9"", so I set the fence about 3"" away from the blade.. That little yellow Gator Zip Sander is awesome!. It is a good idea to add drainage holes in the bottom of a birdhouse. I drilled a few holes inside the grooves on the bottom piece. I also drilled a countersunk hole in the center of the bottom so I could screw it onto the box.. I used yellow, red, blue, green, white, and orange spray paint to paint the sides of the cube. Tape on some paper towels to block over spray from getting on previously painted sides.. Note: One of my YouTube viewers commented that birds stay away from bright colors, like red or orange. Not sure if that's true or if it was just a troll, but you can't build a Rubik's Cube Birdhouse without them! Just be aware that if you want to put yours outside for the birds, do a little research on this ""tip"" and maybe you should paint the front a different color.. I masked off the grooves and painted them black so it would look more like a Rubik's cube. I recommend using a heaver paper than paper towels to block the paint, because the paint did soak through and bleed a little. It was easily scraped off with a razor blade though.. I used regular copy paper to mask off the corners and painted them black as well. The copy paper did a much better job at blocking the paint than the paper towels. Peeling off the masking to reveal the finished paint job was so satisfying!. I printed the original Rubik's Cube logo on a sticker label and stuck it on the center white square. Since I'm going to just display this birdhouse, I made a little triangle stand for it.. If I was going to actually put this outside for the birds, I would probably attach it to a tree or fence. I felt bad that the birds wouldn't get to use it, so I made some less time-consuming birdhouses for them out of cedar fence boards.. Thanks for checking out my Instructable!

"When the Polar Vortex decided to turn New England into a deep freezer, the birds that I regularly feed always looked cold. They would fluff their feathers as much as they could and hunker down as low as possible to minimize the wind effects. The final straw was a Carolina Wren hiding under a board on my daughter's deck. That tiny bird was doing its best to stay warm and ALIVE, and I felt compelled to do something to help. I know there are a variety of roosting pockets and houses available for sale, but I love to crochet and I knew I could make something similar. That is how this project was born.. Note: You’ll need to know basic crochet techniques and stitches to complete this Instructable.. Materials Needed:. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Rnd 1: Magic circle (or whatever your preferred starting ring might be), ch-1, 10 HDC in center of ring; sl st to top of 1st HDC. (10 sts). Rnd 2: ch-1, 2 HDC in same st as ch-1 (ch-1 does not count as st); 2 HDC in ea st around; sl st to top of 1st HDC. (20 sts).

Rnd 5: ch-1, HDC in same st as ch-1, *2 HDC in next st, HDC in ea of next 3 sts; repeat from * around; sl st to top of 1st HDC. (50 sts). Base / bottom is done. Weave in the start tail before you go any further.. Now for the sides.. Rnd 6: ch-1, BLO 1 HDC in ea st around (50 sts) (By using only the back loops, the stitches are forced to stand perpendicular to the bottom.). When I do Back Loops Only, I make sure to pick up two parts of the stitch to ensure a good hold that won’t stretch like a single part will. In the first picture, you can see all the parts on the hook.. The close up view shows you how I find the extra part for this version of BLO.. The third picture shows what it will look like turned upside-down when the round is complete.. Rnd 7 & 8: Using both loops (here and for rest of pattern), 1 HDC in ea st around (50 sts). Rnd 9: ch-1, HDC in same st as ch-1, 44 sts, ch1, sl st in last 5 sts, ch1, join w/ sl st; (45 WORKING sts). Rnd 10: ch-1, HDC in same st as ch-1, HDC in 43 sts ; 2 HDC in last st; ch-2, TURN. (46 WORKING sts). Rnd 11: (ch-2 counts as first st); HDC in 45 sts, ch-1, turn. (46 WORKING sts). Rnd 12: HDC in same st as ch-1, HDC in 44 sts; 2 HDC in last st; ch 6; sl st to join beginning of rnd.. Rnd 13: ch-1, DO NOT TURN; HDC in same st as ch-1, HDC in 45 sts; 4 SC into ch-6 space; sl st to join beginning of rnd. (By using Single Crochet stitches and a chain-6, it causes the opening to arch.). Rnd 14-17: ch-1, HDC in same st as ch-1, HDC in 49 sts, sl st to join, ch-1 (50 sts). Time to put a rounded roof on the shelter (the most complicated part). Rnd 18: (starts with 50 sts) HDC in same st as ch-1, HDC in next st, HDC2tog (decrease), HDC in next st; *HDC in ea of next 2 sts, HDC2tog (decrease), HDC in next st; repeat from * around; sl st to first HDC, ch-1 (10 decreases = 40 sts). Rnd 19: (starts with 40 sts) HDC in same st as ch-1, HDC2tog (decrease), HDC in ea of next 2 sts; *HDC in next st, HDC2tog (decrease), HDC in ea of next 2 sts; repeat from * around; sl st to first HDC, ch-1 (8 decreases = 32 sts). Rnd 20: (starts with 32 sts) HDC in same st as ch-1, HDC2tog (decrease), HDC in next st; *HDC in next st, HDC2tog (decrease), HDC in next st; repeat from * around; sl st to first HDC, ch-1 (8 decreases = 24 sts). Rnd 21: (starts with 24 sts) HDC in same st as ch-1, HDC2tog (decrease); *HDC in next st, HDC2tog (decrease); repeat from * around; sl st to first HDC, ch-1 (8 decreases = 16 sts). Rnd 22: (starts with 16 sts) HDC2tog (decrease) same st as ch-1 and next st; *HDC2tog (decrease); repeat from * around; sl st to first HDC (8 decreases = 8 sts).. Fasten off, leaving enough tail (around 25”) to close top and make a hanging loop. Weave tail through all 8 sts and pull tight. Tie off, then chain approximately 20 links for the loop. Tie off the chain and weave remaining tail very securely through sts.. The completed Roosting Pocket: the first picture is the view from the front and the second picture is of the bottom. I stuffed it to show the shape.. Cut 9 bamboo skewers in half, and use the unpointed pieces for perches. Put three pieces together, then use thread or thin twine and lash them at each end to make a single perch. Repeat the procedure two more times, resulting in 3 perches. . One perch should be inserted side to side, one or two rows above the bottom of the pocket, and centered between the front and back. The second and third perches should be inserted front to back, one to the right and just above the port, and the other to the left of the port and slightly higher. This will give the birds a variety of seating options.. Insert a perch in between stitches at the desired location. Find the corresponding space on the opposite side and bring the end out at the same level.. The pictures show the front view and back view of perch placement:. Once you’ve inserted the perches, hang the Roosting Pocket in a sheltered south- or east-facing location, somewhere where birds would naturally seek protection from harsh weather. Be sure to make daytime checks inside the pocket as winter progresses into spring and the days start to get longer. If you see signs of a nest in progress (addition of twigs, grass, moss, or lots of feathers), take it down immediately -- roosting pockets are NOT a safe place for babies! Even if you don't see nesting activity, it's best to take the pocket down after the danger of frost has passed.. Remove the perches before laundering. They could probably stand a seasonal weak-bleach treatment and then thorough air-dry before being bagged for storage.. According to the Lion Brand label, the yarn I used can be machine washed separately with mild soap on gentle cycle. Use lukewarm water. Do not bleach. It does not require fabric softener and its use is not recommended. Tumble dry on low heat and remove promptly. Hand washing and drying is also an option, using warm water and mild detergent. Rinse well in cold water, then squeeze and roll in a towel to remove excess moisture. Spread item flat on a smooth surface and allow to dry thoroughly. Do not hang to dry..

"Installing a Bird Feeder can allow you to help some species during the middle of winter when food is scarce. You will also be able to observe some of the species that live near your garden, take pictures of them or just enjoy the presence of the bird.. This Instructable explains how to cut and build your own bird feeder with a laser cutter.. Enjoy !. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. The given file is optimized for use with an Acrylic plate or any other material that can be laser cut.. I used 250mm*500mm plates that are 3mm thick. If you want to use another dimensions, you can rearrange the design be be careful to drill adapted slots to mount easily the bird feeder !. You can also get 4 M3 screws to add an holder that will help you to attach the feeder to a tree, or use clamps or glue.. Download the attached file and cut it, you can also add some custom engraving if you want ^^. With a hot air gun, or any other source of heat, you can heat and fold the two bars with holes that will be useful to attach the feeder to a tree. There are tiny holes to help you to fold at the right place. When heating it, the plastic will soften, then you will be able to do a 45° angle with it and maintain it while it cool down.. Be very careful when using hot tools !. Assemble all the pieces together, and use the 14 small ""keys"" to hold all pieces together. Normally all pieces and slots are different so you can't make a mistake building it !. Same thing that the precedent step, you can heat and fold the corners of the roof. Be careful not to heat it too much or the plastic might burn or get ugly bubbles ! Be patient and fold it when the plate is softened over the whole width. I used M3 screws and bolts, but you could maybe use some glue or even clamps to make it 100% plastic ;-). I used some sunflowers seeds to fill it, in France (where I live) some bird like Great tits like them a lot !. Now you only have to find a tree to install it, thanks to it's holders that can help you to maintain it with wire in the holes.. Here you can find tips about locations where to install bird feeders :. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/where-to-put-your-bi....

"Spring is coming up and I'm planing on adding new birdhouses to our garden. I've found and old PVC sewer pipe in my workshop which would be just perfect for this project. I've seen something similar in a garden center, but I'd rather build it on my own and I can recycle the old PVC pipe as well. I'm planing to build two different kind of houses. There will be two similar ones, which are shaped like a mail box for newspaper (horizontal pipe) and one which looks like common birdhouse (vertical pipe with a small roof).. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. I need three pieces from my pipe to build the bodies of the houses. The two horizontal houses have a length of each 35cm (30cm due to the angular cut) and the vertical house a height of 25cm (20cm due to the angular cut). The pipe has a inner diameter of ~10cm. Please see the picture for all dimensions.. I use two parallel wooden strips as a jig, which helps me cutting. I use a saw to cut the pipe. I can use one angular cut for two bodies.. I use a piece of plywood for the back and front. I need two circular pieces and one ring-shaped piece for one birdhouse (two for the vertical house). The diameter equals the inner diameter of the pipe. I use a compass to draw three equal circles, one with a smaller inner circle (the ring should have a thickness of 1-2cm). . I drill a hole into the inner circle and use it to cut it out with a jigsaw. Now I cut out the outer circles.. I repeat this process once for the second birdhouse. The vertical house needs just one circular and one ring-shaped piece.. The front needs an entrance hole and a perch. The diameter of the entrance is very important and defines the type of bird which might be using the house. I've found a nice list of typical diameters for some species: https://www.thespruce.com/bird-house-hole-sizes-386641. You might need a bigger pipe for the big birds :D. I use a foster drill to cut the entrance hole and a normal wood drill for the perch. The perch is a simple round-shaped wooden beam. I use wood glue to mount it to the front panel. I add a stainless hook to the back panel, which makes it easier to remove it later on for cleaning purposes.. The vertical house needs a roof. Therefore I cut a square out of the plywood using my jigsaw. You can use a straight lath as a guidance. I use a edge length of 18cm.. To mount the roof to the pipe I use a router to mill a a small groove into the roof part. Therefore I mark the pipe using a pencil. I fixate the part with my clamp and use my router freehanded to mill the groove. The groove is not perfect, but it's enough for this project. The groove will be later filled with glue and silicone so nobody will notice it :D.. I want to cover the roof with a sheet of metal. I had some spare from building a carport. I cut a square out of the sheet, which is 2cm wider on each site than the roof (22cm). There might be condensed water between the wooden sheet and the metal sheet. Therefore I use a small piece of roofing paper to protect the wood from moulding. I just nail it to the plywood using galvanized nails.. I wrap the metal sheet around the wood, fold it at the edges and use the same nails to fixate it.. The vertical house has no front made of wood. The body itself has the entrance and the perch. Therefore I use a foster drill to cut the entrance and a wood drill to cut two holes for the perch (one on each site). The perch goes direct through the whole body.. I will cover the bodies with spry paint. Therefore I use grinding paper to roughen the surfaces and water to clean it up afterwards.. Let's get some color, shall we? I hang the bodies on a rope and start painting the inner surfaces and edges. While the parts are drying, I build a small rack, which will help me during the painting process. . The parts are dry and I mount them to my rack. I can rotate the parts just by rotating the rack. During the rotation I can apply the paint evenly.. The wooden parts need a coating as well. I use three layers of white paint, which is suitable for the outdoors. The perch is going to be red as a nice eye-catcher :).. Now I can mount the front and the ring-shaped parts to the bodies. I use three stainless screws and three plastic washer for each part. The plastic washer will seal the hole and will keep the water outside. I mark three spots equally around the pipe and drill small holes with a thin drill. I fasten the screws using a screwdriver. Be careful and do not apply to much force.. The perch for the vertical house goes right through the body. I use a small screw on the back to fixate it.. I glue the roof to the body using waterproofed glue. Well that's it almost :). My jigsaw, ok, well I did a poor job with cutting out the round shaped parts. To fix that and to make the house waterproof I add a small amount of silicone to the gap between the wood and the ""house wall"". I'll do that with all front and back panels and the roof.. The birdhouses will hopefully house some birdies over the spring and summer. To clean them in fall, I add a simple hatch to the back. It's just a lid fixated with screws. The lid covers the ring-shaped part.. Congratulations, everything is done and you are hopefully a proud owner of some new birdhouses. Let's take them outside for a foto shooting in the wilderness :D . I use two different methods of mounting the houses. Method one is just a nylon rope within a tree. Method two are pipe clamps mounted to a shed or carport. It's important to face the entrance to the right direction. As far as I know, the birdies like their doors pointed to east/east-south direction (opposing the weather face).. I hope you will enjoy building this. Please let me know your experiences and improvements. Please put photos in the comments. :). Participated in the Trash to Treasure."
"We recently moved into a new house which has huge picture windows. One of the side windows looks out onto a narrow side yard. We placed our cat's large tree in front of that window and then hung a couple bird feeders on hooks on the fence outside so he would have some ""cat tv"" for entertainment. This was okay, but the feeders hung too low, the big hooks were expensive, and the seed got wet since we live in the wonderful Pacific Northwest. So we needed a better solution.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. I made a hasty sketch and roughed out my ideas. My priorities for the structure were:. 1) it could hold multiple bird feeders. 2) it would provide a shelter so the seed would not get wet. 3) the structure would be flexible so that feeders can change throughout the seasons. 4) the size would be large enough to ""fill"" the 7ft picture window width. 5) it would be tall enough so the view was maximized for people sitting in the front room looking out that picture window (and for the cat!). 6) it would help obscure the view of the neighbor's house and back yard.. Then I called my dad and talked about what was needed to turn the sketch into a viable design - proper roofing, increase footings, etc. (Thanks Dad!).. Here are the items we used for our build:. (Quantity - Material). 2 - 4x4x10 treated wood posts. 1 - cardboard concrete tube (cut in half), we used an 8"" wide tube. 2 - 80 lb bags of Quikcrete. 7or 8 - treated or untreated 2x4x8 lumber (they are not in contact with the ground, so we used untreated). 1 - treated 2x6x8 lumber. 2 - untreated 1x4x8 lumber (you will have quite a bit left over). 1 - 4x8x3/4 exterior grade plywood (cut in half lengthwise by the DIY store). 1 - 8 ft length of 3/4 metal electrical conduit pipe. 2 - 5 ft lengths of 5"" ducting pipe. 1 - package of 3-tab asphalt shingles (I got a damaged package from Home Depot for $10). 1 - roll of asphalt paper (you will have LOTS left over after this project). 1 box - 3/4 inch roofing nails. 1 box- 2 1/2 inch exterior screws. 1/2 box - 3 inch exterior screws. 1/2 box - 1 1/2 inch exterior screws. 4 - EMT straps (U-shaped ones with a hole at each end). 6 - Slant Nail Joist Hangers. 2 - 1-9/16-in x 3-9/16-in Rafter Ties (this holds a 2x4 on top of the 4x4 post). 2 - L-brackets. staples. These items were a mixture of purchased items and ones we had on hand, so I am sure improvements/changes could be made in the materials list. NOTE: I got most of my metal fittings from Habitat for Humanity's Restore at a great price since they sell them by the pound.. The tools we used: circular saw, hand saw, drill, speed square, staple gun, post-hole digger, hammer, 2-way post level, level, angle grinder.. The window is 7 foot wide, so we positioned the posts to line up with the ends of the window. We dug 2 holes approximately 25 inches deep and about 10 inches wide with a post-hole digger. Then we threw all the stones we hit while digging the holes into the bottom. Next, we cut the cardboard concrete tube in half using a hand saw, and placed one half in each of the holes, on top of the stones.. We placed one 4x4 post in each of the holes, inside the tubes, and braced them using various materials we had on hand. Then we mixed up the two bags of Quickrete and put one in each hole around the posts. We used a stick to tamp down the concrete around the posts, then left them to set (sorry, should have taken a picture at this point).. The next weekend, we removed the bracing and covered over the top of the concrete with the dirt we removed from the holes. The cardboard tubes were a bit proud of the ground, but those can be trimmed later (I intend to pave that side yard eventually, so I just left them proud for now). Finally, we put the 5"" diameter ducting down over the posts. NOTE: trying to set the ducting into a round shape was infuriating until I looked up a video on the easiest way to do it. We had to sand down the corners on the posts in a few places in order to adjust the placement of the ducting on the post. I thought we would need to secure the ducting with a screw or two, but it holds tight with just a friction fit.. Next item was the roof ridge. We placed the metal fittings on top of the 4x4 posts without screws and set the 8 ft long 2x6 on top so that we could check to see if it was level (of course it wasn't). Based on the reading, we trimmed a post and then fixed the fittings and the 2x6 in place with screws.. Looking at the structure, I decided to add another 2x4 immediately underneath the roof ridge to a) add stability and b) provide a wider surface upon which to mount the electrical conduit pipe that would hold the bird feeders. So we used L-brackets to mount the 2x4 with the 4 inch side against the bottom of the 2x6. This meant that we were forcing two metal fittings into a very small space on each end, but we managed to squeeze them in. In hindsight, I am sure there is a much easier and cleaner solution for this. Afterwards, we screwed up from the bottom of the 2x4 into the 2x6 and that provided some much needed rigidity to the structure.. Finally, we trimmed the metal conduit pipe to fit within the posts using an angle grider, then mounted it using the EMT straps. By using large EMT straps and pushing the ends together a bit, the pipe is able to hang down about an inch below the 2x4. We then hung a large sunflower feeder, a hummingbird feeder, and a nyger seed feeder on the pipe using S-hooks. The use of S-hooks on the pipe allow for the greatest flexibility of hanging options. Early customers to the feeders seemed quite comfortable with the structure so far.. Now we could move on to the roof. Reading up on how to do roofing in regular construction books and online, I found shed instructions to be the most helpful (probably because they were working with small, light structures). I couldn't find anything specific on the type of roof I wanted, so I just made it up (apologies to those people who know about roofing!).. Now we already had a fixed measurement on the roof panels: 2ft x 8 ft (the two halves of the original 4x8x3/4 panel). This drove all of our remaining roof measurements. Eyeballing the angle with a 2ft piece of plywood scrap, I determined that I wanted the roof to be between a 5/12 pitch (it would drop 5 inches for every 12 inches of run) and a 6/12 pitch (it would drop 6 inches for every 12 inches of run). That would be sufficient to protect the feeders, but not obscure the view of them. I also decided to use 2 inches of the 24 inch width of the plywood to act as an overhang.. Now using the Pythagorean Theorem - in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides - I determined that my existing roof panel (24 inches minus 2 inches of overhang) was essentially the hypotenuse. Based on that calculation, I set the crossbar (the b of the calculation) down approximately 8 inches below the top of the roof ridge. We secured the crossbar on each side with screws, then cut two 2x4s to connect them. This essentially created a ""box"".. The 8ft length of plywood needed to be supported, so we placed three rafters on each side of the roof ridge. The first rafter we cut from 1x4. Based on the earlier calculation, we cut the rafter to approximately 23"", mounted a joist hanger on one end and then held it up in place to determine where the ""birds mouth"" cut would be to have it sit on the ""box"". We also marked where the end of the rafter needed to be trimmed so that it would be in alignment with the plywood top. Once we had this template rafter, we cut the remaining two for the one side of the structure. Everything was then screwed into place. We repeated the same process for the other side (we had to adjust our measurements slightly for the other side).. We placed one plywood piece on top of the rafters and screwed it into place. Then we did the same with the other plywood piece on the other side. There was a slight gap where the boards butted against each other over the roof ridge, but that would later be covered by the roofing materials.. Then we measured out two pieces of roofing paper approximately 9ft in length. We centered one piece over one side of the structure and made sure there was approximately 5 inches of overhang at the bottom and enough at the top to cover over the gap to the other plywood piece. This was stapled in place along the top first to hold it while we shaped the other sides to wrap around the plywood pieces. We tried to make all the corners look as neat as possible, then stapled everything in place. We repeated this process on the other side of the roof.. I went to one of the local DIY stores for my supplies and found the shingles which were close to the color of the shingles on the house. There was a broken package of shingles on the floor and they agreed to sell it to me for $10 (60% off!). . I read up on how to attach shingles, and followed their instructions (mostly). So we started by trimming a starter row of shingles and put that at the bottom of the panel, then laid the first row of shingles on top of that row. We then staggered the next two rows of shingles. The other roof panel was done the exact same way. Finally, we covered the roof ridge. We didn't use specific shingles for the roof ridge. Instead, we just used individual shingles to cover the roof ridge.. Now because we used a broken package of asphalt shingles we were probably one row short on each side of the roof, however I don't think it is detrimental to the structure since the panels are completely covered. The effect is mostly ""cosmetic"". . The shelter has now been in use for several months and it has worked very well. I am able to change out the feeders easily, the food stays dry, and the birds are comfortable with the structure. The only design issue we've had is with water occasionally dripping down the roofing paper in heavy rain, but that is not really going to damage the structure. Beyond that, it can be a bit dark under the structure, so I am going to add a cheap string of solar lights to the inside so that the birds are easier to see.. Did you make this project?

 . Yes, I have a healthy squirrel population here. At the moment, they are jumping from the nearby fence to the roof of the feeder stand and then they have access to the end feeders. The pipe on the uprights really limits their access. If I didn't have the fence (or other close launching point), they would not be able to access the stand. . I am stuck with the limitations of the site, so I have a ""sacrifice"" feeder stocked with the cheapest seed mix I can find for the squirrels off to the side which is easier to raid.... © 2020 Autodesk, Inc.."
"So I saw a bird house made like this so I gave it a shot. I liked the natural look with a little man made ( dare I say Steam Punk? ) look. It wasn’t that hard and I made it with stuff I had sitting around my garage. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. A hunk of tree. I used a piece of wood that was basically unsplit firewood.Chain saw or ban saw.Forstner bitDrillHammerWood chiselsWood screws Tin or aluminum ( or some other roof material option )Pallet wood or some other flat piece of woodDrill bits . Find the right piece of wood. It’s diameter needs to be enough so you can rip it, sawing off the back 1/3. I cut the piece of wood down to a manageable size before ripping the back of it. I used a chain saw to rip the back but depending on the size, a ban saw might work. . Now, you need to start “gutting” a nesting place out of the large piece. You’re cleaning the wood out from the back of the house. Before you clean it out, think about where your entrance will be coming in from the front and the size of the bird your trying to attract. There are plenty of web sites out there that will tell you what size bird house entrance will attract what species of bird. I used a Forstner bit to clean out the house. . I cut most of the house out and then drillled in from the front to make sure the living space was lined up with the entrance. The forstner bit is perfect for that. . So I cleaned it out. I made sure the entrance was not too long. Now, I took a piece of aluminum pipe used for exhaust vents and cut a piece to cover the “roof”. I wanted to give it a little different look but was also hoping it would keep rain off the top of the house. Attach the roofing material ( my roof didn’t look spectacular but again, it was the first one I made).Now, how are you going to close up the back of the house? You can use the original piece you cut earlier. I used a piece of pallet wood and attached it with the wood screws. You may want to drill some starter holes to prevent splitting. . I forgot to take picture of a couple of the final steps. Sorry about that. But here’s the final product. I used the pallet wood on the back for a different look and so it would be easier to hang the bird house on my fence. I’ll make a few more birdhouses soon and try to perfect the process. I may try cleaning out the birds living quarters with my chain saw instead of the forstner bit to see if it speeds up the build. But in the meantime, happy building! ."

"I saw this funnel and I was inspired to make an awesome bird feeder out of it. I wanted it to look like something my grandparents would have bought at the feed store in the 1930's. With a little searching, I was able to find the rest of what I needed to complete it with the look I envisioned. This is an easy to build project from ready-made parts that can be sourced at most home or hardware stores. It can be completed in an hour or two with simple tools. I like the farm store/industrial/grain silo look and I know that it will look good for lot longer than most feeders you can buy.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. The Tools you will need are as follows.. Drill. step drill bit or a set of drill bits 1/16"" to 3/16"". rivet gun. carpenters square. flexible measuring tape. center punch. T-reamer (optional). dull side cutting pliers. sharpie. grinder with cut off blade (not sawzall as pictured, more on this later) . tubing cutter (optional). Here are the materials you will need.. big metal funnel (tractor supply has these). 8x6 duct reducer (any home store should have these). pie plate from the thrift store (it should be of smaller diameter than the funnel so water won't drip in). 1 3/8"" fence cap (you might have to get this at a fencing store, the home stores don't carry it) . 1/4"" copper tubing 6""-8"" long . 1/16"" cable (old bicycle brake cable will work). 1/16"" ferrules. small fender washers. 3/16"" x 1/8"" rivets (aluminum). metal plumbing tape (pre-punched holes means no drilling or measuring). First we need to cut the end of the funnel off so that the cap will fit. It also makes the opening bigger so that it is easier to fill the feeder with birdseed.. An easy way to transfer the diameter of the cap to the funnel is to make a template out of card stock. After you have traced the circle make sure to draw the actual cut line about 1/4"" to 3/8"" higher so there will be something sitting inside the cap. . Cutting with a sawzall was not the best way to do this. It jumped around and shook and made a pretty uneven cut. I have used a grinder with a cutoff wheel on something like this before and would recommend it as a much better method. A hacksaw might work if that's what you have.. Using the center punch, mark two points where you want to drill holes for the cables that will suspend your feeder. Look inside before doing this to avoid drilling through the thick part of the funnel neck. Now drill with a bit slightly bigger than the cable.. This is the part that keeps the cables separated so they don't hit the top of the feeder. Cut the tubing long enough so that when it is bent to the desired width, the ends will point straight down. Six to eight inches is about right. I used a tubing cutter and a reamer but a hacksaw would work. Next bend it around a round object that is the size you need. I used the front of my drill.. Pass the cable through the cable separator. Push the cable end into the funnel. Put a washer and a ferrule on it. Crimp the ferrule with a pair of cutters, the duller the better, you don't want to cut, you want to smash. Do this on both sides. . Unfortunately, there will be math on this project. Measure around the duct, divide by three. Whew, I'm glad that's over. I used the metric side of the tape to make it easier. Mark the three points with a sharpie. Use the square to mark 3/4"" down from the top to keep things even. Now use a square to transfer the measurement to the bottom of the duct so you don't have to do math again!. Plumbers tape breaks with a little back and forth bending. Bend a piece that has three small holes. Break it off and repeat. You'll need six pieces the same size. If the rivets are a little bit too big for the holes, ream them so they fit.. Center punch the three marks at the top of the duct. Using the step bit, drill to 3/16"". It's pretty easy to drill too far in sheet metal and make a hole bigger than you wanted, so when it starts to go through the metal, stop pushing. For some reason the 3/16"" rivets didn't fit in the 3/16"" hole I drilled so a half twist with the reamer made it work. Now pop those straps on.. For this step it's helpful to put the funnel in a can, bucket or flower pot to hold it while you work. Use a square to center the duct on the funnel. The trick is to keep adjusting until it's the same measurement all the way around. When it looks like it's centered, make some marks so it will be easy to put it back. Make a dot with the sharpie in the center of each end hole in the strap. When you're satisfied with the marks, punch and drill just like before. . Put the top and bottom together and push a rivet through the holes. You can put one hand inside and hold them together while you squeeze the rivet tool with the other hand. Make sure the strap is pushed all the way down on the rivet before you squeeze the handle.. The duct should hang a little below the rim of the pie pan so it will stay full of seed but not spill out. To do this, we will first bend the straps in the solid part just above the small hole on the end. Pliers make this easier. Now hold one of them against the bottom of the duct with the distance of the desired gap sticking out. Mine was about an inch, yours will depend on the depth of the pie plate you found. Make a dot on the duct in the small hole at the top of the strap. Use the square to transfer this measurement to the other marks. Punch and drill just like before. . To center the duct on the pie plate, use the same trick with the square from step ten. Transfer the three marks from the duct onto the plate. Now measure in a about 1/2"" from where you marked the duct. (I used the holes in the plumbers tape as a tape measure.) This is where you will drill. . Center punch and drill three holes. Test to see if the rivets fit, ream if necessary.. Rivet the straps to the inside of the duct with the bent part facing down.. For the last step, put the funnel in the can like in step ten. Lining up the holes can be tricky because you can't put your hand inside at this point. It will help if you put a rivet in the holes one at a time. It takes two squeezes to pop a rivet. I did one squeeze on each rivet and went back around a second time and finished it. For a finishing touch, clean off the sharpie with a Q-tip and alcohol.. There you have it, a bird feeder that looks cool and will last forever. The best way to fill it is with a funnel. If you worry about moisture getting in you could put a tiny blob of silicone on the holes where the cables go through, then pull them tight while it dries. I didn't feel the need to do this as the steep roof will shed water quickly. I remember in the past 3/16"" rivets fitting into the holes in plumbers tape, maybe things have changed or my memory is wrong, but it's not too hard to make them fit. .

For birds and other wildlife, water is just as important in the cold months as it is during summer. Even in places with abundant snow and ice, it costs birds precious calories and body heat to melt frozen water. Backyards that provide fresh, clean, liquid water during winter tend to host more avian visitors than do frozen yards. . Here are some tips for providing water for wildlife during the cold months: . - Place baths in a sunny area to make them more visible to birds and to help keep the water from freezing. . - Help birds stay dry and drink more easily by adding several stones to the bath or placing a few sticks on top that the animals can use as perches.."

"The idea to build this log cabin bird house came after storm Ophelia passed over Ireland on the 16th October 2017 causing a lot of damage to property and also uprooting and knocking trees. During a brief let up in the winds I ventured outside for a look around only to hear and see a hedge nearby alive with birds taking shelter from the storm. I don't know if they were frightened or if it was the sheer number of them but the noise they were making was deafening. I would never cut down a tree to make a bird house so I spent some time the following day collecting small branches and sticks that had been broken or had fallen during the storm. This project was made using only hand tools.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Have a look at the video above to see how I built the log cabin from start to finish.. The only hand tools needed for this build are:. A hammer. Hand saw. Tenon saw. Hatchet. Utility knife and blades. Materials:. Sticks . Some pieces of pallet wood (Roof). Panel pins. Polythene. Grass sod. Chicken wire. Staples. Glue. I started off by cutting a piece of the pallet wood to 8 inches (200 mm) x 6 inches (150 mm). This piece will eventually become the floor of the bird house but to start I will use it to set the size of the cabin. Using my tenon saw for a finer cut, I cut a number of pieces of sticks for the front, back and sides.. Next using a utility knife I striped all the bark from the sticks. The sticks I used were from a mix of 3 trees. Ash, hazelnut but I don't know what the third type was. The bark came away easily as the wood was still very fresh.. I set the sticks around the pallet wood base and marked the intersections where they cross over with a pencil.. I then marked a curve to half the width of the sticks and set about carefully cutting out the curve with a sharp utility knife. This process does take a bit of time. I test fitted the joints as I went and did adjustments where required.. When I was happy with the joints I applied a little exterior wood glue before nailing it with a panel pin in each joint.. Once the first set of logs (sticks) were pinned it was just a matter of fitting each log in the same way as before until I reached the height I was happy with. For the entrance I fitted a log as normal and then cut the ope before pinning it. For the last two logs on each side I left then about a half inch longer, this was to create an overhang for the roof.. The roof pitch is somewhere around 25-30 degrees. I cut a few rafters and pinned them together before attaching them to cabin. I was going to add more rafters but felt it did not need them as these rafters were going to be attached to the gables and this would be good enough to hold the roof. For the gable logs I marked them off the rafters to get the correct angle to cut them. I then pinned them in the same way as before.. I needed something to support the grass roof so i used some pallet wood I had. Using a hatchet I cut off the edge to form a miter along the ridge where the two pieces of the wood would meet. You don't really have to do this as it will all eventually be covered but I did. When I was happy with the fit I attached all the pieces of wood for the roof using panel pins.. I added some trim/fascia also make from sticks all around the edge of the roof . This was to hide the edges of the grass when it was fitted and also to hide the edges of the pallet wood i used for the roof.. At this stage I attached the base that I had cut earlier. I just used longer panel pins to do this. I may need to remove the base again some time to clean the inside and it should be easy enough to it by removing the pins I put in.. To help protect the wood and waterproof the cabin I stapled on some polythene and then some chicken wire. This was to hopefully prevent the grass sod from slipping on the polythene. I trimmed off some of the extra polythene at this stage.. I went to a corner of my garden, far away from view and using a knife I cut up some grass sod. Take your time doing this and peel a little at a time until it is removed. Place the sod onto the roof and gently pack it into place and cut off any excess. I am not entirely sure how well the grass roof will hold up over time. It should be fine for autumn, winter & spring in Ireland anyway but I fear in the summer months it will dry out if not watered. Time will tell.. And this is it! The finished log cabin bird house. I hope you like it and maybe have a go making one. It is an easy project to make using only a few hand tools but it will require a little patience when doing the joints. This will probably be the biggest log cabin I will ever get to make so I think that's why I spent the time doing all the joints where I could have came up with something a lot quicker and easier to make. I am glad I spent the time making it and am very happy with the result and I think it was a good way to use some of the fallen wood from the storm. The rest will probably end up in my stove!.

"Birds don’t like soggy sunflower seeds! . I live on Vancouver Island on the west coast of Canada where the winters are mild but can be quite wet. In the past I have had to dispose of a lot of wet, moldy birdseed and clean out the feeders. In this Instructable I am upcycling an old satellite dish and using it as a rain shelter for my birdfeeder.. The feeder originally hung from a tree on a wire and even though the feeder did have a bit of a roof on it the fill hatch at the top didn’t seal very well. In order to employ the satellite dish effectively I decided to mount both the dish and feeder on a fence post; this involved constructing a bracket to support the feeder from the bottom.. This is a fairly easy project and can be accomplished by anyone with even very basic maker skills. The project can be completed in 1 day although if paint is involved allow 2 days.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. 1 Orphaned satellite dish. 1 Bird feeder with 3/4” post mount hole in the bottom. 2 step washers (3/4” shoulder with 1/2” step and ¼” through hole). 1 ½” EMT conduit pipe x 1” long. 1 2-1/2” x ¼” bolt. 1 ¼” nut. 3 ¼” flat washers. 1 ¼” fender washer. 1 ¼” lock washer. 1 1” x ¼” x 14 ¼” piece flat iron. 1 1” x ¼” x 6 ¾” piece flat iron. 1 3/8” x 3 ½” piece of rebar, cut on 45 degree at each end. 4 #14 x 2” pan head wood screws. With exception to the welding (optional) most of the project is doable with very common shop tools:. . Start out by modifying the satellite dish arm to allow it to mount closer to the post. To accomplish this simply cut the curved part of the pipe off (you can use a hacksaw or, as I did, a zip disc on a handheld grinder). Being as the dish will be mounted with the back skyward it is a good idea to drill a small hole in the bottom lip so collected rain water can drain away.. Next cut away the two tails that extend from the back of the dish beyond the lip. Cut them flush with lip on dish. This ensures the dish will fit close to fence post.. I used 1” x ¼” flat iron to form the bracket but there are plenty of options here including a purchased bracket from the hardware.. Cut two pieces of iron; The horizontal piece 14 ¼” and then drill a ¼” hole at one end (1” from end) for attaching the peg to support the feeder, the vertical piece of iron is cut to 6 ¾” and drill two ¼” holes in one end (one at 1” and the other at 3 ½”). The two pieces were welded together at a 90 degree angle (weld the ends without the holes). I also welded a short piece of 3/8” rebar as a corner brace but wouldn’t have been necessary.. Assemble the peg; insert 1 step washer on the ¼” bolt followed by the 1” piece of ½” EMT, then the other step washer, then the 3 flat washers and finally the fender washer. This assembly is then inserted into the ¼” hole in the horizontal leg of the bracket, pointing upward. Slip the ¼” lock washer over the end of the bolt and attach the assembly with the ¼” nut. Tighten.. This is a good time to spray paint the bracket (I used a grey color somewhat close to the feeder and satellite dish).. While the bracket is drying install the satellite dish. Locate it fairly high on the post, the feeder has to nestle up under it. I used large #14 x 2” screws so predrilled with a 1/8” drill bit. Tilt the front of the dish upward slightly so collected water runs back toward the drain hole drilled earlier. Leave the adjustment screws on the dish bracket snug but not too tight, this allows you to tilt the dish up easily to fill the feeder.. Once the bracket is dry you might need to wrap a couple layers of electrical tape on the peg to provide a snug fit with the hole in the bottom of the birdfeeder. With the feeder sitting on the bracket, hold the bracket up on the fence post below the dish, mark the location of the mounting holes and predrill with 1/8” bit. Next install the bracket with two #14 x 2” screws and set the birdfeeder in place on the peg. To fill the feeder you simply push the dish upward on its bracket, remove the fill cap on the feeder and pour in the seed.. Was this a perfect solution? Not quite, the rain is sometimes accompanied by wind; a little wind is no problem but gusts still tend to blow rain into the feeder although a lot less than before.. I hope you found this Instructable helpful and even if didn’t have a satellite dish to upcycle you at least found inspiration for creating your own birdfeeder shelter solution (perhaps from other upcycled material like hub caps, garbage can lids or cooking wok)..

"Why my interest in a new nest box design?. I inherited an interest in birds from my father, whose family grew up next door to a bird expert. Ruth Thomas studied and banded birds and wrote, “Crip, Come Home” as well as, “Brush Goat, Milk Goat” and a weekly column on birds in the 1940s in the Arkansas Democrat Newspaper. Many of my relatives have fed birds (including hummingbirds) and land-lorded Purple Martins and Bluebirds. I finally upgraded to property that lent itself to land-lording in 1998. My plastic Purple Martin gourds last forever, while my Bluebird houses have been replaced many times over the years. In researching PVC as an option, I ran into the Gilbertson design but thought it was overly complex and had some risk for dropping the nest-box onto the ground, so I designed my own nest-boxes and put them into use in 2016. With only 1.5 acres for 5 nest-boxes, 2017 saw 13 Bluebirds and 20 House Wrens fledged from the new boxes.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Advantages:. PVC post – Entire assembly can be moved inside for winter if desired (may extend product life). PVC vs Wood Nest Box – Cheaper, fewer parts, easier to make and assemble, longer life. Moose vs Gilbertson – Cheaper, fewer parts, easier to make and assemble, heavier and better insulated. Supported from bottom, so no risk of nest-box falling from a top-suspension design. Slit vs Round opening – No sparrows, easier feeding of older nestlings. Mobile, vented floor – No moisture, fly larvae may fall through, easy to expel spent nest. Removable Roof – Easy viewing and photography of nestlings. Removable Nest Box – Easy viewing and cleaning. Bucket Guard – Cheaper than metal and no seams with exposed screws for climbing snakes. 3.5”x36” Steel U-Post. 2”x5’ PVC pipe Post. 4” to 2” PVC adapter. 4”x6” PVC pipe Nest Box. 4” Qwik Cap. 3.75x3.75” hardware “cloth” floor. 6” carriage bolt floor anchor. .67”x11.25”x12” roof. 5-gallon bucket predator guard. Table saw and/or Sabre Saw. Xacto Knife. Trauma Sheers or Tin Snips. 2.25"" hole saw. Hand Drill and Screwdriver. Post Driver or Sledge Hammer. Pre-assembly instructions (see pictures):. 1) Cut 11-12” Square Roof and glue it to rubber Quick Cap . (gorilla glue is good but expands when curing; use knife when done to cut away excess glue). 2) Cut two pieces of hardware cloth and assemble with 6-8” centered bolt. Bolt works as center-weight to keep floor from tilting and as plunger to expel spent nests . 3) Cut 4” PVC to 6” length; cut 2.5x1.25” entrance slot into Quick Cap with Xacto Knife. 4) Put Quick Cap onto Nest-Box and trace opening to cut matching entrance to Nest-Box . 5) Cut two 1.75”, vertical, ventilation slits opposite the entrance slot from upper edge of Nest-Box. (slits will extend ~1/2” below Quick Cap when roof is in place). 5) Cut 2” PVC post to ~5’ length . 6) If planning to add predator guard inverted bucket . a. Use hole saw to cut 2.25” hole in bottom of bucket . b. Measure ~11” down from top of post and wrap masking tape around post; make it level . c. Drill 1st hole along upper edge of tape . d. Measure 2.5” to left and right of hole to mark 2nd and 3rd holes for screws . e. Screw in the three short screw so screw-heads project a few mm. 1) Choose a location. 2) Place a post smaller than 2”; U-posts and retired chain-link posts work well. 3) Cover with 2” PVC post ~5’ tall. 4) Slide optional inverted bucket guard until suspended by 3 screws in post. 5) Add 2” to 4” PVC converter. 6) Add 4” PVC Nest Box. 7) Add hardware cloth base to Nest Box and cover with pine-needles. 8) Add 4” Qwik Cap to top of Nest Box with entry slit matching Nest Box slit . (11-12” roof glued to top of Qwik Cap in pre-assembly). 10) Gelstain post & nest if wanting to blend better with landscape. (Stain inside of nestbox during pre-assembly if wanting darker interior). With just one nest box, I usually get 2-3 broods of bluebirds each year with an average of 5 eggs per brood. With several boxes, I often have two active nests at a time despite the territorial nature of bluebirds in a 1.5 acre space. I can have 10-20 babies fledging per year, so over the past 20 years here, we have had more than 300 bluebirds fledge. The chickadees and house-wrens also like the boxes.. This year with the new box design, we fledged six chickadees (only one brood per year), 20 house-wrens, and 13 bluebirds. The wrens and bluebirds are quite welcome, since anything that eats insects on my property is an asset.. There were no snake attacks. I have had three over the years, so decided to add the buckets during my upgrade this year. We have black rat snakes that are quite talented in getting to nests, and we also have raccoons and squirrels. The slot near the roof has kept out the starlings, but in the wooden boxes, we still got sparrows at times. This year, the new design didn't seem to interest the sparrows at all.. . This file is a Word document with all of the info from this instructable, so it would be easy to download for reference offline while building your own nest box.."
"My wife wanted a bird bath on our balcony. Unlike a traditional pedestal bird bath, we don't have a garden hose nearby to clean it; so it needs to be easily and quickly removable for taking inside to clean. We also live in a condo, so we can't permanently affix it to certain parts of the building. This is my solution. PVC stand affixed to the balcony railings, with a removable bath.. Parts. Tools . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. The basin is going to need to be screwed in and out of place for cleaning, so you want it high enough that it clears the deck railings. . Measure the height in the railings and add an inch or two as desired (the top connector is going to a little height as well).. Mark a cut line on the PVC to the height you determined in the previous step. Using a hacksaw, chop saw, or radial arm saw cut the PVC pipe to length along the cut line. Just make sure it's a straight 90 degree cut, otherwise the connectors may not fit properly.. Before cementing the connectors in place, you should clean the PVC pipe so they will adhere correctly. Goo Gone and a paper towel worked well enough.. Check the fittings of the cap and threaded plug to ensure they fit correctly. What I didn't do, but should have, take some painters tape and cover the threads inside of the threaded plug. This will prevent the possibility of the glue/cement getting into the threads.. Following the directions on the primer/glue, and only install once connector at a time. Wearing protective gloves, apply a thin coating of the primer inside the connector and outside the pipe. Apply an additional thin coating of the glue over the primer, and push the connector onto the pipe (without twisting it). Wipe off an excess glue.. Repeat with the other connector on the other side of the pipe.. The Gorilla PrimaGlue worked for me in this step, but depending on the material of the basin you chose you may need to opt for a different glue. Apply a thin coat of primer to both surfaces. Then apply a thin coating of glue/cement to both surfaces and attach them (push, don't twist). Depending on the glue you may need to apply pressure for the bond to adhere.. Scrape off any sticker/labels and remove the adhesive residue with the Goo Gone. . Use the painters tape to tape off the opening of the threaded plug, so you don't get paint or primer on the threads. Apply spray primer to the PVC pipe. Apply additional coats as needed. Apply a spray paint as desired.. I temporarily used packing tape to adhere mine in place. My 8"" zip ties were insufficient. 14"" fit well once I bought them. You can measure the diameter for your installation to find what will work best. Two or 3 points of attachment should work well. Once it is firmly in place (and not rotating), you can screw the basin into the top. Fill with water. Now wait for birds to actually find it.. Maybe birds don't like translucent baths two stories up? I took the bath down, masked off the screw threads, and painted the outside. . Maybe too late in the season, I've only managed to get one photo (of poor quality) of birds checking the bath out so far.. Participated in the Outside Contest 2017.

"When your friends or family have an empty wine box like this one and they don't know what to do with it, you can turn it into a great bird house! All you need is a small wine box and a wooden dowel to get started.Other materials you will need are:- a pencil- a ruler- a small saw- a drill- drill bits- scissors- a thin but strong rope to hang it by- a backyard for the bird house*the dowel should be about 1/2 an inch in diameter and be at least 4 inches long. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. A) Slide the lid off the box and pull out the handle.B) Flip the box upside down.C) Saw your wooden dowel so that it is 4 inches long.D) Mark where 2 inches below the existing hole in the box is.E) Start drilling by making a small hole with a small drill bit, and then change your drill bit so that you are using one which has a slightly smaller diameter than your dowel.F) See if the dowel fits through the the new hole you drilled, and if it almost fits then take a hammer and hit it into the hole far enough that the wooden dowel doesn't move.. A) Put the lid back on the box and drill two holes in the lid centered about 3 inches apart. You should make the holes wide enough for your rope to fit through.C) Maneuver the lid half open with both holes still on the inside of the box, then thread the rope through the holes.D) Cut and tie the rope at whatever length you think will fit your trees or bushes best.. You can put twigs or leaves inside your birdhouse if you want, but the birds will change their nest to how they want it to be. And if birds aren't attracted to it, consider building a bird feeder nearby.Enjoy watching birds make their home!. Participated in the MacGyver Challenge. Participated in the Box Contest 2017.

"In India, birds like sparrows have notable decrease in number. In summer the temperature exceeds over 48 degree Celsius at midday. We can't see any birds at that time. So I decided to make a birdhouse for birds. The Birdhouse is recycled and harmless to Birds. Small Birds like Sparrow can play on it and eat their food beating the heat. It is made up of Small Coke can.. NOTE: 1. The Birdhouse should not be kept in direct sunlight . Can will heat and it will be unsuitable for Birds.. 2. Big Birds like pigeon can cause imbalance and can pour all your loaded food.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. 1. Can of any size . 2. 2 Zip Ties. 3. Rope. 4. Cutter which can cut the can. 5. Small piece of wood. You can get it from a carpenter.. 6. Dish wash liquid. Cut the mouth of can with the help of cutter. . The cut portion may harm Birds. So please make it safe by polishing its endpoints.. Now, wash the inner side of can with dish wash bar as the sugar remained inside the can can also attract insects.. Now, with two zip ties make the T-shape as shown in Image 1. Then attach with can with piece of wood as shown in Image 2.. Insert the rope in Zip tie so that we can hang it.. Hang it at place where it will be protected from sunlight and add bird food.. Now your Birdhouse is ready. . Thanks for stopping By...... Happy Making!!!!!. Participated in the Beat the Heat Challenge 2017. Participated in the MacGyver Challenge.

". I have 33 trees on my property and tons of wild birds. Most of them live in the very tops of the trees where I can't see them come and go very well. I like to keep birdhouses in the trees closest to the house so I can watch and enjoy the birds.. If you have the tools already living in your workshop/garage one birdhouse will cost a little under $7.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. If you are new to working with PVC and want more in-depth information I highly recommend enrolling in the PVC Class taught by audreyobscura!. You will need the following tools and materials to make a PVC birdhouse. (If you have access to a CNC machine this would be SO much easier. You could cut precise wooden circles with cutouts for the front and back of the birdhouse. A different saw would also make this much faster, however, I am a gal with limited access to tools!!). . Tools & Materials. 1. Measure and mark an 8 inch long section of PVC. Mine came in two foot lengths so I ended up making three birdhouses (they make great gifts!). Draw a diagonal line at an angle of your choice starting at the 8 inch mark. Mine was approximately 60 degrees.. . 2. Clamp the PVC to a work table and using a handsaw cut along the angle. As always, tools can be dangerous. Please use caution.. . . . 3. Using a metal file, smooth down the cut edge removing any bits.. . 4. Sand the entire surface with the 100 grit sandpaper. This will remove the words/lettering on the PVC and prepare it for painting. Be sure to rough up the entire surface including the inside of the cut angle.. . Each of the wooden rounds will need holes drilled. The front piece will need the main hole for the bird to fit through and the back piece will need a few vent holes.. I purchased these wooden rounds at Michael's for $.99 each. They are beveled and about 3/4 inch thick. I wish they weren't that thick but they worked for this application. If you can find thinner ones use those! This was overkill.. 1. Using an electric drill fitted with a 1 1/4 inch drill bit, drill a hole in one of the rounds positioning it toward one side (not in the middle).. . 2. Change the drill bit to 1/4 inch and drill a hole half way through the wood. Position it right under the larger hole This will be for the perch later. (You can see in the image that I failed to drill this before painting...big mistake! don't forget this step before painting! The paint just chips off around the hole and will have to be repainted.). . 3. On the other wooden round, mark where three vent holes should go, I lined them up along the top edge in a row. Change the drill bit to 1/8 inch and drill the holes.. . . ***To avoid chipping the wood you can place a piece of tape on the wood before drilling and drill through the tape. The wood I used was really soft, but if you used something harder it probably wouldn't require taping and wouldn't chip so bad. I did one each way and the one I didn't tape chipped really bad (I had to fill it with wood putty). Boo.. . . Choose two paint colors that you like. One for the PVC and one for the front and back pieces. . 1. In a well ventilated area on a covered work surface, or spray booth, spray paint the PVC. Don't forget the back edge! Let dry according to paint can directions.. . . 2. Spray the wooden rounds. Let dry thoroughly.. . . 3. Cut a 2 1/2 inch piece of dowel and paint desired color(s).. . If you have a CNC machine the sanding part of this step won't be necessary. The wooden rounds I purchased weren't actually 4 inches so they had to be sanded to fit inside the PVC.. 1. Using 220 grit sandpaper sand down the edges until the rounds fit in either side of the body of the birdhouse. Dry fit them to assure a good fit.. . . 2. Run a bead of glue (I used Weldbond) around the flat edge of the birdhouse.. . . 3. Inset the back side piece of wood to secure in place.. . 4. Using a quick square measure to find where the front of the wooden round will sit and mark with a pencil. This will tell you where to run the bead of glue.. . . 5. Run a bead of glue. My pieces fit really tight so I used a mallet to gently pound the wooden face into place.. . . 6. Squeeze a dab of glue into the hole on the face and secure the dowel for the perch.. . More drilling coming up!. 1. Fit your drill with a 5/64 inch drill bit (or what matches your eye screws) and drill two holes on the top of the birdhouse. One toward the front and one toward the back. It might be tempting to just put one hole in the center, however, the birdhouse won't hang evenly once a bird decided to nest in it.. . 2. Twist in the eye screws until they are secure. I matched up the front eye screw with the wood to secure it further.. . 3. If your paracord isn't already cut, cut a 24 inch piece and burn the edge with a lighter to prevent fraying.. . 4. Thread it through the eye screws and tie a knot to join the ends.. . 5. Hang in a tree and enjoy!. . Participated in the Box Contest 2017. Participated in the Outside Contest 2017."
"Years ago, my son bought me this birdhouse for Christmas. He found it at his school Bazaar, paid 50 cents, and gave it to me knowing I love ""make it pretty"" projects. At the time however, I had a cat who was a very proficient hunter, and felt bad louring birds to their death. He has since passed away, and I just remembered about the birdhouse that has been waiting patiently to get beautified. . I have some fake dollar store flowers, scrap booking paper and mountains of glitter, so I decided today is the day I get this project finished!. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. First you need a birdhouse. This one seemed to be a first attempt, maybe from a kid? It's heavy and well assembled, just not aligned completely. Also, my dog chewed on the perch, so I'll have to fix that.. You will need white multi-purpose glue, a paintbrush, scrapbooking paper, a knife,a cup to mix with, scissors, large Popsicle sticks, Guesso, glue (I used gorilla, you can use Krazy glue or anything sturdy), a hard plastic straw, fake flowers, glitter, glitter paint, sticky gems, sparkle tape.. Mix the multipurpose white glue with water at a 50:50 ratio. . Paint this mixture over the side of the birdhouse. . Place a piece of scrapbooking paper flush against the top edge and smooth down.. Using scissors or a knife, cut the excess paper and press down the edges.. Repeat on other side.. I needed to replace the perch anyway, so I cut it off with the knife before I applied the paper.. Paint on the glue/water mixture.. Place the paper firmly against the wood and trim the excess.. I ripped the top of my paper and needed to patch it up. I used a corner of the same design paper and cut along the edges of one of the flowers, then pressed it into place and smoothed it down with more glue/water.. The get the entrance hole, I poked my fingers through and painted the edges down with more glue/water.. Using the same technique as the sides and front, glue the paper onto the roof.. I used a different pattern on each side.. The side with flowers had leaves that extended past the center so I cut them out and using some of the glue/water mixture, smoothed them down over the plain side.. I tried gluing a different pattern of paper on the wood edges, but it was too rough and textured for anything to stick. I therefor applied a heavy coating of Guesso, and will use glitter paint on it after the Guesso dries. Birds like glitter right?. For the new perch, I was looking for a chopstick, but instead found an old (but very solid) wiggly straw.. Cut the straight part off the straw and glue it beneath the entrance. Hold it tight until the glue is dry enough that you can leave it without it tipping over.. When the glue is completely dry, cut off a single flower from the bouquet of plastic dollar store flowers. Place the stem into the hole in the straw.. Take 5 very large Popsicle sticks (you can get them in almost any craft section), and lay them lined up on a flat surface. . Cover the bottom of the birdhouse in glue and place it gently on top of the sticks. . Add more glue to the front of the Popsicle sticks (to help hold them together).. When the glue is still wet, place assorted flowers against the front of the house.. Wrap glitter tape around the perch if you don't like the color of the straw.. Paint the edges of the roof with glitter paint.. Paint the Popsicle sticks with glitter paint.. Sprinkle glitter over the ""garden"".. Press sticky back gems around the entrance.. Paint over the entire birdhouse with a layer of the glue/water mixture.. Let dry.. Participated in the Before and After Contest 2017."
"One of the problems I always had with bird feeders is they get all nasty when it rains. The seed gets wet and clumps and you have to take the feeder down, clean it out and let it dry before putting it back up.. This is my solution. Easy to make with almost no tools, very inexpensive, and the birds love it.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Start by getting a bowl or dish shaped bottom to hold the birdseed. It can be most anything you want. The one in my example appears to be a small jell-o mold. I picked it up at the Goodwill store for 99 cents. The top is a larger and shallower shape. It will be upside-down on the feeder, so make sure it will not hold rainwater. Other things you might try would be metal pot and pan lids or Frisbees – use your imagination and your feeder will be unique.. Cut a support piece from a dowel or broomstick. It might be fun to use a straight section of tree branch for a rustic look. Eyeball the length of this support piece (no measuring required). It should be long enough for birds to get to the food tray, but short enough so that windblown rain won’t wet the seed.. The hard part is putting holes in the top and bottom pieces. In my example, the bottom green dish is soft plastic and I could easily drill a hole. I could also have just poked a hole with a hammer and nail, but I wanted to show off. Don’t make your hole too big – just large enough for your screw to go through.. My top piece was hard plastic. Drilling it would crack the plastic, so I just heated a nail with a propane torch and melted a hole. If you don't have a torch, a lighter will work. Just don’t burn yourself.. I used an ice pick to put starter holes in the top and bottom of the dowel. A small nail would also work to get the screw started. Like the nail I used to melt the hole in the top. Be careful not to stab yourself. You don't need to make a deep hole, just enough to get the screw started.. You will need a hanger for your bird feeder. If you have a screw eye, you could just use that. I didn’t have one, so I made a hanger from a bit of wire using needle nose pliers. You could use a piece of a coat hanger for this. If you don’t have needle nose pliers, just wrap the wire around that nail you used earlier to punch the holes.. Now, assemble your feeder. Careful not to tighten the screws too hard or you might break the plastic. . Fill your feeder with some seed (I used sunflower seed), hang it outside your window, and have fun watching the birds! I hope you try making your own and have fun with it.. Participated in the Before and After Contest 2017."
"This is a cheap and easy to make bird feeder for use with apples, oranges and similarly sized fruit. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. The photos show the finished bird feeder. It consists of a vertical ring through which a removable bamboo skewer is fitted for holding the fruit in place. This is zip tied to a horizontal ring, which is also fitted with a (shorter) skewer to prevent the fruit from sliding or turning on the first skewer. The second skewer only needs to enter the fruit a centimeter or so.. The top of the vertical ring is fitted with an eyelet screw for hanging the feeder from a branch or similar with a piece of string or wire.. 1. Two rings made from 2 cm sections of 110 mm PVC waste pipe. I used pipe with a wall thickness of 3 mm for added sturdiness.. 2. Four 150 mm zip ties (you can use shorter, but then tying them will be more difficult).. 3. Two bamboo/wood/plastic/metal skewers.. 4. One eyelet screw.. First cut your two 20 mm sections from a piece of 110 mm waste pipe, preferably with a wall thickness of 3 mm. If you have a band saw available, this step is extremely easy. But even with a jig saw or hand saw there should be no problem.. Drill two holes in each ring opposite each other, as shown in the first picture. The holes should be a little bit larger than the thickness of the skewers. My skewers were 4 mm thick, and accordingly I used a 4.5 mm drill bit.. Drill a smaller hole in the top of the vertical ring for the eyelet screw, according to the thickness of the screw.. Next cut your skewers to size: 170 mm for the longer one, and 110 mm for the shorter one work well. Birds will welcome the protruding ends of the skewers to grab onto.. Nip off the sharp point of the skewers for your and the birds' safety.. If you want to paint your feeder, now is the time. Roughing up the surfaces of the rings with some sanding paper will help the paint adhere.. Loosely fix the two rings to each other with the zip ties as shown in the first picture. The second picture shows the result you should have now. Now adjust the rings so that the holes face in the correct direction, and tighten the zip ties. Cut off the excess lengths of zip tie.. Lastly fix the eyelet screw to the top of the feeder.. Congratulations, your feeder is finished, and can be hanged from a branch. . Birds should flock to it in no time after discovering the treat awaiting them.."
"This is a variation of the one-board birdhouse available at Lowes.com. Their plan did not allow for an easy clean-out so I modified the floor and a couple of the joints.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. You will need:. Materials:. 1 ea. 1""x6"" untreated cedar dog-eared fence board.. Interior/exterior glue. #6 x 1-1/4"" screws. Paint (optional). Tools:. Drill with hole saw and 3/32"" & 5/32"" bits. Screwdriver to fit your #6 screws. Saw. Brad nailer and 1-1/4"" brad nails (optional). Tape measure & pencil. Cur the following lengths from your fence board:. 2 ea. 9"" pieces for the roof. 2 ea. 8"" pieces for the ends. 2 ea. 5-1/4"" pieces for the sides. You can cut these a bit shorter, 5-1/8"", to allow some ventilation under the eaves.. 1 ea. 3-7/8"" piece for the floor. Lowe's cutting diagram for reference. I changed a couple of things.. https://www.lowes.com/creative-ideas/pdf/One_Board.... For the entrance hole, use an appropriate size for the bird species you want to attract. Center this on one of your 8"" pieces, 3"" from the bottom. If you are using a screw to hold the floor in place, center a 5/32"" hole 3/8"" from the bottom edge. Optionally, you can use a cabinet latch instead of the screw to hold the floor to give the house a no-tools clean out. If you plan on mounting this on top of a fence post as I did, you'll want to use a screw in the front. A cabinet latch would be unusable with this type of mounting. Think ahead, in other words.. Also, drill the 5/32"" holes for the floor hinge screws now in the 5-1/4"" side pieces. These would be drilled 1"" from the back edge and 3/8"" from the bottom edge.. If you use hummingbird feeders, you can use the scrap entrance hole plug for part of a cheap ant moat, I have another instructable that covers that.. Cut 45° angles on the front and back pieces. I use a radial arm saw so I set the beginning of the cut at 5-1/4"" from the bottom edge, cut one side then flip it over and cut the other side.. I bevel the roof pieces and the floor piece with another 45° cut. I like the way they fit together this way. Lowe's plan call for a lap joint on the roof. You can do it this way also. Trim 3/4"" from one roof piece in lieu of the 45° angle.. The bevel in the floor piece simply eliminates any interference in the floor pivot, but you can simply whittle off some of the back edge of the floor if you find it's binding when opening the floor.. Now you can glue and clamp the front and back to the sides. After the glue has cured, I put a couple of brad nails on each joint. Alternatively, you can drill and screw these joints.. At this point you'll want to attach the floor. It's harder to do after the roof panels are on. I know.. Move the side of the house to the edge of your workbench and place the floor in position, bevel side down. Through the pre-drilled hole in the bottom corner, drill a 3/32"" pilot hole in the floor piece. Install this screw loosely. Repeat for the other side. Once you're happy with the way the floor is centered, drill the same hole in the front of the floor piece for the latch screw.. A note on painting. If your house and roof are to be different colors. Now is the time to paint them separately.. After you have installed the floor, glue on the roof panels and secure them with nails/screws once the glue has cured. Depending on your glue, you may need to use a couple of pieces of masking tape across the ridge to hold them in place. I used Loctite PL375 adhesive in a caulking gun and didn't have this problem.. Paint it as you wish! My barn ad stencil was made by Etsy.com seller Glassy Witch, if you would like this stencil or something custom, look her up on Etsy. (Check out the Wikipedia page on Harley Warrick as he painted most of the ""Mail Pouch"" barns across the United States.). Enjoy!. If you cut the 45° bevels, you'll have some triangular pieces of scrap on the bench. You can glue this into the underside of the roof ridge. If you are drilling into the roof ridge to add eye screws, this just adds a bit more strength.. Another barn art idea I had was to use pop cans as tin signs. I used carpet tacks to attach them.."
"I like to shop in resale and thrift stores for dishes, vintage glassware and surprise items. I've seen a lot of vintage lamps with large glass globes in various colors just sitting forlornly on the shelves and wondered what I could make with them, since they weren't very sellable as is. Then one day it hit me - Bird Bath base!. Next you will find my instructable for an easy Bird Bath using various pieces of glass and a pretty lamp base. Enjoy.... Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. First you will need a vintage lamp with some colored glass in the design. You can find one at your nearby thrift or resale shop or at a garage or estate sale Shown is two different lamps that are suitable. I ended up using the first one, with the iridescent globe.. Next you need a shallow bowl, tray or dish made from glass. Again your resale or thrift store or garage or estate sale is a good source for glass with a pretty design and for colored glass. Your bowl should be about 24"" diameter or whatever looks pleasing with your lamp. Also pick up a couple of glass dishes that stack nicely and look well together. Stay away from pieces that have a lot of intricate design that will not sit snugly with your other pieces. . I found this gorgeous vintage lamp with a large iridescent white globe. I already have a pretty good collection of glass serving pieces that would be perfect for a bird bath so I picked one with etched calla lilies.. I love my Dremel 4200 for cutting holes in glass. In fact, I'm on my second one. For this project I will use a Dremel 1/4"" diamond drill bit with Dremel Cutting Oil.. I also need a pair of pliers, a pair of side cutters, Dremel Metal Cutting Wheel with EZ Lock adapter, Dremel Plastic cutting wheel with EZ Lock adapter and a good glue that is weather resistant and waterproof. Loctite and several others make good ones.. I sell my creations and have found out the hard way that no matter which glue I've used, they eventually fail, which is why I also drill holes and insert a rod to hold everything secure.. Disclaimer: I received NO compensation or recognition from Dremel while I was writing this Instructable. I have no ties or connection to Dremel or any of its employees. I'm entering a contest and hope to win a new Dremel but that hasn't happened during the time I wrote this lesson. I genuinely love my Dremel and use it often. I also have not received anything from Loctite for the above mention. I just happened to have a new tube available. . Since we will be drilling holes in glass you need at least a good pair of Safety Glasses. Your own prescription eyeglasses are not enough. Get a good pair and use them often. Sometimes I use a full face protector so that I'm not inhaling glass dust or getting glass dust on my face.. Wear a pair of gloves that have good gripping since glass gets slippery. Also wear a long sleeved shirt buttoned up to the collar when drilling glass. . I like to use ear plugs when I'm drilling. It's loud and high pitched and I want to keep what hearing I have.. You will also need a stainless steel threaded rod that is 1/4"" diameter and about 36"" long. . I like to use rubber or soft plastic washers and 1/4"" metal washers between the pieces of glass.The amount needed depends on how many pieces of glass you're stacking. Grab a dozen each - you can always use them for your next bird bath. . You also need nuts to fit on your threaded rod. Three should be enough. I forgot to photograph the nuts but you can see one threaded onto the end of the threaded rod. . I added a solar light to this bird bath. You can find those at your local hardware or big box store or dollar store for ,99. . Last but not least you need a topper - something pretty like the splashing bird votive holder I found. I've also used orphan glass lids that are colored or clear, angels, animals, fish, etc. . Remove the lamp shade if your lamp has one. Next remove the harp by pushing up the metal thingeys and squeezing the edges of the harp together. Then lift up. Voila!. Turn your lamp upside down and remove the felted paper that covers the base opening. You won't need it again.. Use your side cutters or a pair of wire cutters to cut the cord. Make sure it isn't plugged in before you do this.. Go back to the top of the lamp. Pull up on the gold fixture. It should reveal a knot of cord wires. Pull them out of the lamp. Easy Peasy.. There is a rod through the middle of the lamp with a threaded area at the top and the bottom. Unscrew the nut at the top using your pliers. . Lift up the pieces of your lamp off the rod then remove the rod from the base piece. Save the rod for another project. . Wash and dry your pieces carefully. . I plan to re-stack the lamp parts the way they were for this design. Using your stainless steel 1/4"" threaded rod place a plastic or rubber washer, metal washer and a 1/4"" nut on the end of the rod.. Finger tighten another 1/4"" nut just above the base piece. See the first picture. . Starting with the base, stack the lamp parts on the 1/4"" rod. Add washers and a nut any place where your parts close around the rod. . Using your Dremel, 1/4"" diamond drill bit and Dremel Cutting Oil drill a centered hole in all the glass pieces that aren't already open. For instance, the large white globe on my lamp has a wide opening so I can leave it as is. . I start with a drop of cutting oil then carefully lower my Dremel bit to create a circle in the glass. I add a drop of oil frequently to keep the area lubricated, which cools the glass and reduces the friction between the glass and the drill bit.. Some people put glass under water to keep it cool while drilling. Others use a drill press and have to rig up a way to cool their glass with water, like spraying it with water or immersing it. I never had any luck with the water cool or the drill press method of drilling glass. I broke a lot of pretty glass and spent hours at the drill press.. That's one of the reasons I love my Dremel 4200. I can drill holes in glass in minutes and I rarely break a piece of glass. I just wish Dremel sold the cutting oil separately because my diamond drill bits last longer then the oil that comes with it.. I chose this small wavey edge glass bowl to go upside down between the lamp part and my bird bath piece, just because it looked nice. Add a metal washer and a rubber washer to the threaded rod then stack that baby on your threaded rod,adding another metal washer and rubber washer.. Glue the glass bowl to the lamp part if you want. I chose not to use glue in this bird bath because the pieces fit together so well and the balance was so good. If I was stacking more glass on glass pieces I would have added a good glue. . Add your large glass bowl or platter for the actual bird bath.. You don't want a piece too deep here. Look around at the birds in your yard. They're bathing in shallow puddles. They don't want to swim. If you've chosen a deep bowl add something to make it shallow - a plate, a pretty lid, an upside down dish. Whatever you have that looks good. . Use the metal and rubber washers both under your bird bath dish and on top. You'll see why in a minute.. If you're using glue add it to the bird bath dish before you put it on top of the dish below it. Follow the directions on the glue. If I'm using glue I will often wait a day or so for the glue to set up before I move my creation again.. The topper not only looks pretty on top of the bird bath glass, it also covers the washers, lets me add a snug washer and a solar light.. Your topper will need to have a hole drilled into it if you've chosen something like I did, with a votive candle place. On top of your threaded rod, after you've placed your drilled topper, place a metal washer and a rubber washer. . If you chose something big like a pretty glass lid as your topper you will need to add your washers and a 1/4"" nut finger tightened on top of the bird bath piece. Follow the instructions in the next step to cut the threaded rod.. Using your wonderful Dremel set up with the EZ Lock adapter and a Dremel Metal Cutting Wheel cut off the excess threaded rod. . First, put on your safety glasses, long sleeved shirt and gloves. This will send sparks flying all over the place and they sting if they get your arm or hand.. I couldn't cut off my rod inside the candle holder so I marked where to cut on the rod, removed it from the bird bath and then cut it off. After that I replaced the cut down rod through all the pieces, including the washers. . Make sure you have a nut attached to the part that remains before you cut the rod off because you won't be able to thread it on afterward. . Then finger tighten a 1/4"" nut onto the rod and snug it down with the pliers. Don't put any muscle into it or you'll crack your glass. Just make it snug.. Remove the long metal sleeve from the clear plastic housing. Just twist and remove.. Remove the clear plastic ""globe"" from the light holder by twisting slightly and pulling of... Place the plastic ""globe"" in your top piece. Mine was a little taller than I wanted so I needed to cut down the clear plastic piece. . Mark the plastic where you want it cut off. . Pull out your Dremel with the EZ Lock Adaptor and a Wheel for cutting plastic. Put on your safety mask or safety glasses and slice the excess plastic off. . You can glue the clear plastic into place if you want. I chose not to because I think it will be easier to clean my glass pieces if they're not glued down. Just place the clear plastic piece, attached to the bulb and solar collector, into the well on back of the bird - where the votive would normally be placed. . . Pull out the orange tab when you're ready to use the bird bath. I hope to sell mine so I'll wait so the buyer gets a fresh solar light.. Time to repeat the disclaimer. I received NO compensation from Dremel for making this Instructable. I own the Dremel used in this lesson and use it often. I find it the most versatile tool I have. Again, I received NO compensation or recognition writing this lesson from Dremel. I plan to enter this Instructable in a contest and possibly win a new Dremel but that hasn't happened now.. I've made many Bird Baths. Some use lamp bases. Others use various glass pieces like bowls, plates, vases, glasses and candle sconces. It's fun to build a tower of various glass pieces then anchor them with a wide, heavy glass light fixture, microwave plate, or bowl to keep them from tipping over. Drill through the pieces and insert a threaded rod and anchor with nuts and washers. Or glue each piece to the next. Or do both to ensure your creation stays together. Next Instructable I'll show you how to make a bird bath tower of all glass pieces. . Thanks for viewing my lesson. Now go out there and create some beautiful Bird Baths.

 . Hi! It looks so pretty I want to make one for my garden. Should I seal the base with something like modge podge to protect from the weather?.

 . If your base is glass the answer is no. If it's something like the metal lamp base I used the answer is ""I don't know. Mine have never stayed around long enough for me too see how they age. Mod Podge or a spray of clear paint would probably work to protect it but be sure to do both inside and outside..

"What ?Birdhouses. Why ?. - to help the birds- to have a relaxing birds singing in the garden - to play/spend time with kids (during project making) - to create unusual and personalized decoration for Your garden- to be eco ;-). Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. There are no universal birdhouse. Their sizes and shapes depends on birds which are ment to live in them. Do some research what birds are in Your area.Then search for a good house sizes on the internet.. In my case, I chose house for sparrow, so my dimensions are: Entrance - 33mm Height - 240mm Depth - 110mm. Remember: Distance between bottom and the entrance can not be to short to avoid predators (ie. cats). Do some cuttings. In fact You will only need just:- two same sizes sides - one front - one back - the roof. I recommend to cut first the rear, than the front and then You will know how cut the sides and the bottom. The roof should be about 2' (5cm) longer than whole birdhouseMake the hole for an entrance (use drill, or thin saw, or eaven carving, sharp knife). Make small drill holes in front and rear desks to avoid wood splitting. Now connect those parts with the sides with screws. That's all!. Bird's doesn't mind if they live in painted or not painted home, buyt You do. Painted birdhouses could be very decorative and could give something new to Your garden. That's all. You have nice looking birhouses. Now wait and enjoy birds singing in the spring.. If You enjoy this instructable - subscribe my profile as well as youtube channel..

"I built this to give my kids a close up observation of our backyard birds raising their young this Spring. It was a fun project we were able to do together and enjoy for many seasons ahead. It's really easy to build and requires only common shop tools. Here's how I did it.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Supplies. Any Common Birdhouse. Suction Cup Set. Tools. Optional. Use a table saw, rotary saw, or miter saw to cut off the back of the birdhouse. My table saw was able to rip through this in less then a minute.. I used 4 suction cups to stick the birdhouse to my sons bedroom window. Hammer a small nail through the center of each suction cup. Then, nail each suction cup to the back of the birdhouse. In this picture you see only three cups on the birdhouse; however, the finished product actually has four. Three would have worked fine, but then I would have had a spare cup with no use.. Clean the surface of the window you intend on hanging the birdhouse. Now, firmly press the birdhouse to the desired location. There are a few extra tips to consider when hanging your birdhouse. You should at least know which birds frequent your backyard. Depending on the bird, their height and hole dimensions can vary greatly. Here are a few common dimensions from AmishGourds.."
"Recently, I moved into a new house where the backyard is not much else but grass, a couple trees, and fencing. Somehow, the yard just did not have enough life in it. To fix this, my family and I decided on attracting the neighborhood birds to our yard with a bird feeder. This has worked very well, with whole flocks of birds visiting our yard every day for the seed, but still, our yard is quite clear of any decoration. To begin to fix that problem, I decided to build a birdhouse, which is not only good for decor, but also would bring even more birds to our yard. If you would like to do the same for your backyard, or just want to build a birdhouse for the fun of it, then this instructable is for you.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. For this birdhouse, you will need:. -Plywood with a 1/2 inch width. -Plywood with a 3/4 inch width. -A drill (~1/16 inch drill bit). -An electric saw (or a really good hand saw and some muscle). -Sandpaper. -2 hinges w/ screws. -A pencil. -Measuring tape. With the 1/2 inch wide plywood, you will want to cut 2 rectangles with the following dimensions:. 8.75""x6.5"" - door. 6.5""x1.5"" - wall between door and roof. With the 3/4 inch wide plywood, cut 3 rectangles with these dimensions:. 10""x9"" - roof. 6.5""x8.75"" - back. 6.5""x8"" - base. Additionally, with the 3/4"" plywood, cut 2 trapezoids with these dimensions:. 8"" - base. 9.5"" - side. 11"" - side. Draw the dimensions for a bird hole on what will be the door. The center of the hole should be 2"" from the top of the door, and the diameter should be 1.5"". Using a drill, bore holes on the circle. Try to make them as close together as possible. After this, the piece will likely still be stuck, so using the drill, try to drill diagonally by entering one hole and drilling towards another. This should work to free the piece, and form the hole. . Another way in which this could be done would be to drill a hole in the middle, and then using a hack saw, make a cut on the circle.. Now that the piece has come out, the hole is there, but with rough edges. Using sandpaper, sand the inside of the hole until the hole is smooth and circular. In the image above, I could have continued sanding to make it even more circular, but I thought it was good enough. Main thing is to sand until the hole is smooth (Don't want the birds to cut themselves).. Mark out where the 2 hinges will go on the door and the side piece. This can be done with pencil, just in the picture, I have the screw entry points marked with the screws themselves. Make 1 hinge 1/2"" from the bottom of the door, and the other 1/2"" from the top of the door (Note that this is unlike the picture, where the hinges are not centered). Once this is done, drill holes in the marked points for the hinge screws. Finally, place the hinges on the marked places and screw them into the door. . Next, find one sidepiece, and connect the door to the 11"" side of the trapezoid shaped sidepiece. Make the bottom of the door be a shade more than 3/4"" from the bottom of the sidepiece. This is to make sure the door can swing freely into the door frame. Once in position, screw the hinges into the sidepiece. . Using nails longer than 1"", connect the pieces of the birdhouse. Start with the base and the back piece. Hammer the back piece onto the base, allowing the base to be underneath the back piece. Make sure the base edge is flush with the back. . Take a sidepiece, and position it so that the 9.5"" side is flush with the back. Also, make the 8"" base flush with the base, so that the bottom of the sidepiece becomes part of the base. . Next, connect the 6""x1.5"" piece to the 11"" side of the sidepiece. Make it flush with the front of the sidepiece. Be sure it is positioned so that it makes the third side for the frame of the door. . Connect the sidepiece holding the door like the other sidepiece is connected, but on the other side. Be sure the door can fit in the resulting door frame. . Lastly, fit the roof onto the birdhouse. Center the roof widthwise. Make the back of the birdhouse flush with the back edge of the roof. . After putting all of the wooden planks together, you should have a completed birdhouse! Of course, if you would like, you can add paint, add a perch, or anything else to customize it. Keep in mind, the dimensions used in this instructable by no means need to be followed. If there is a certain type of bird you would like to attract to your backyard, make sure you do research on what the proper dimensions for the birdhouse would be for the best chance of seeing it, including what hole size would be needed, and adjust them accordingly. If you do not mind who visits your backyard, then just follow these dimensions to be safe. Hopefully, this instructable serves as a good guide for building a birdhouse.

"This instructable is more about caring about our little friends Tit Birds, and reasonable usage of food products rather then the feeder itself (because it's not working wery well).. So why do we care about Tit Birds?. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Because they are cute as hell!. Also they're great helpers at the gardens. During the Winter they eat bug larvas hidden in tree bark, and at the Spring and Summer they eat bugs themself. They eat all bugs but a lot of them are harmfull pests.. In order to survive the Winter, Tits (and it was quiet a discovery for me, when I googled the name for translation) need to have a reliable source of fat in their ration. And this is where we'll talk a bit about salo.. Here in Ukraine we love salo (I'm not the author of the picture), it is a national product, and you can read about it in this wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salo_(food)). Basicaly salo is raw pig fat with skin and some meat inclusions (or without meat at all), which can be preserved by salting, smoking and other ways. Salo is a great Winter fat source for Tit Birds and they like it a lot.. But first, we have to make the feeder (if you decided to do so rather than use simpler way about which I'll talk at the end of the instructable).. I've got a pair of these cheep wooden spatulas that came as bonus with some bakery products. The markings on one of them are representation of future transformations.. And here's the transformations and the tools I've used to accomplish them.. I finished it with a coat of boiled sunflower oil. This is the feeder now, and I'll show you how it works a bit later.. Because now it's time to prepare our salo. And this is a ""rational usage of food products"" part.. In our family we always collect leftover pieces of this product that aren't that fresh anymore to be eaten (although it can be kept in the fridge for a long time), and we use it for Tit Birds at Winter. But at first we have to cut off any salt or seasonings because it's not good for the birds. I'm planing to melt those cut offs into technical grade lard and make outdoor candles with it, but this is a project for the other day.. When we have our pieces ready, we can attach them to the feeder with a twine using holes and notches we've made in the spatula earlier (now their mysterious nature is revealed!!). The simpler way to feed a Tit Birds with a salo I was mentioning, is just to tie a twine to the piece and tie other end to the branch. But it's not that easy, sometimes, to tie a knot in cold conditions, and you have to take the twine off the tree at the Spring, because it can grow into the branch. In this way my feeder is winning, because you can just hook it on and even reach a higher spot. But in the same way it looses, because strong wind can knock it off the branch, and currently local cats heve already stolen the thing. Also you can bunch a few pieces of salo on it, which is harder to do with just twine, so maybe making deeper cut for hook opening can redeem this design.. Unfortunately I didn't photographed the birds at my feeder, because it's hard to get close enough without scaring them, and my camera gives me more frustration than photos. So here's some pictures from google image search results.. Aso I'm understanding that such product as salo may not be available in you country but it can be substituted with a bacon, for example, or lard, or any animal fat in any other form until it contains no salt or seasonings. Just make some research.. So. This is it. Thank you for your attention and have a nice Ti... time... I was thinking about time.."
"The goal of this ible is to show you how to make a simple birdhouse out of four nails, a bit of glue, and a scrap of plywood (at least 14 inches x 19 inches, anything bigger is gravy). This is a great project to do with kids!. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. This bird house is tailored for chickadees, but you can of course modify it to suit whatever bird you are trying to attract. I chose chikadees because they are friendly birds that stick around through our cold Canadian winters, and can easily be tamed to come eat out of your hand, especially if you are giving them tasty treats like sunflower seeds.. The house I am building is meant for chickadees that live in northern climates. Depending on the bird and climate, the size of the hole will varry. For Chickadees, 1-1/8 inches is the normally quoted size, but this will be a bit too small in northern areas where they get plumper. In Canada and part of the norther United States, increasing this to 1-1/4 inches is a safe bet. You will also notice that there is no peg; putting a perching dowel is a feature that will attract different birds. In these dimensions, sparrows would quite like the house if it had a perch.. For this project, you need . The tools required are. If this is going to be cut by kids (be it by hand or electric depending on age), pre-drawing the lines will be nice. If you are doing this with a table saw and are comfortable using the fence, you can get away with a list of the dimensions and just use the fence to size everything.. What you will need are two pieces that are 4 inch wide for the front and back. The front should be 8 inches long, and the back needs to be at least 11 inches long, but you really want to get it 12-14 inches long. The first 9-1/2 of the back make up the wall, and the rest will keep going below the bird house so you can easily fasten it. If your piece of wood allows it, you can make the house a few inches higher.. The sides should be the 2x the width of your ply (so with my quarter ply, that's half an inch) plus 4 inches. So the sides are 4-1/2 x 9-1/2. Since you will be cutting the slant for the roof in the sides, you can keep them as long as you want if you are just cutting up scraps and won't re-use anything else, and just trim it to size when you add the taper.. Lastly, the base is going to be a 4x4 square, and the roof a 5x6 inches.. The hole should be centered on the front piece's width, and 6 inches up from where the base will be.. The walls will be 8 inches high in the front, and 9-1/2 in the back.... or whatever lenght you ended up with after the kids cut the pieces.. Laser lines on saws are genrally pretty gimicky, but this is where I actually like having one. Since we can mark our sides using the front and back and draw a line between the points, we are getting a pretty random angle. Following that line with the laser guide (not to position the saw, but rather just the rotation of the base), you can get the correct angle to your saw very easily.. In preparation for installing the base later on, we want to drill two holes in each side. These holes will be very close to the bottom edge, and about half an inch in from the front and back edges. The drill bit size you select should match the nails you are using, so that they can slide in and out, but not fall through. This is because our base just rests on the four beds, for a dirt cheap mechanism. No need for hinges, and it will hold just fine.. You will also have to drill the opening for the birds on the face plate. In this case, I am making a 1-1/4"" hole that is centered just over 6 inches away from the bottom edge (kinda eyeballed it).. Adding a knob to the underside of the base by gluing a bit of scrap to it will make it easier to handle the base.. Everything except the base just gets glued together. You can get away with using 2 clamps, but 4 is better. Assemble all the walls at once. Once that is dry, you can glue on the roof.. Now that everything is done, you can slide the base in and inster the nails to prevent it from falling back out.. You can now go out and install your bird house. For chickadees, it should be at least 4 feet off the ground, and as much as 12 feed up. If you have more than one, make sure they are very spaced out, as the chickadees could get a little territorial.. Participated in the Homemade Gifts Contest 2016."
"What ?. It's winter now, so it's good idea to feed some birds. Not everyone has a good bird feeder and not everyone has an ability to make one. So, I will present fast and easy way to make bird feeder which can be hanged in the garden or on the balcony.. Ingreedients:. -fat/lard. -seeds. - cake forms. - straw . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. First You need to heat up the fat. Not much, just to make it fluid.. Then mix it with the seeds. . Mixed fat&seeds now can be putted into cake forms. Remember however to put the straw(or small stick) in each one.. When mixture get cold and will be solid, get it out from cake forms. Then remove the straw. It will create a hole for the twine (or tape). Put the twine there and now You are ready to hang bird feeder on the tree/balcony.. Thank You for reading my instructable. If You want more-subscribe my channel as well as my Youtube channel.."
"hi all.first of all im sorry for my bad English. this is my first post on instructables. this is a really easy to make finch house that too many kind of finches love it.. its natural. its wood. its your handmade. :). this finch nest (finch house) tested in cage of Zebra finches, Java finches and Gouldian finches.. in the first pic u see two chick of zebra finches (Both female) that goes to the nest for rest n sleep.. i hope it will be helpful for you guys.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. this is all you need for making this house.Tools :. 1. Drill (its better to use of corded drill instead of cordless because coconut is very strong.). 2. Hole saw (For finches i used 51mm (2 inches) hole saw but you can use any size for any bird). 3. Knife or something to extract coconut meat.. Material :. 1. Big Coconut. 2. Small wood stick (10cm (4 inches) is enough). 3. Sawdust or Cottonseed or any other things for make the nest soft.. first of all you should make your coconut clean and cut of all hairs. (coconut hairs can use instead of Cottonseed). coconut has 3 eye and one of them is easy to open. so open it with knife and extract sweet water of coconut.. pick a hole saw due to the size of the bird that you make this nest for. 50mm (2 inch) is good for finches.. select the area that you want to make it entrance of bird house. its better to choose it under coconut eyes because the house should be a little deep.. in the center of the area that you choose for entrance drill a 5mm hole before using hole saw.. use the hole saw to make the entrance and due to size of your wood stick make another hole under it.. you should extract the coconut meat from the entrance hole and i suggest to do it easily to prevent cracking.. after extracting if you have some cracks like mine you can fill them with wood glue.. insert the wood stick to the hole and use wood glue or mdf glue to fix it.. your finch nest is ready. fill it with any material that u think its better for your bird.. i used cottonseed in on of finch houses and also used sawdust for another one.. last three pics are another model of nest that has bigger entrance and it can use for bigger birds.. if you have finches in cage its better to fill the nest with cottonseed and give the finches a little grass or something like that. Finches love to build their own nest.. for fixing the bird house in cage there is too many ways that depend on your cage and the place that you want to fix it.. i used thick wire and hang it of the top of the cage and after that use a little epoxy to paste it into the cage.. i hope this instructable being useful for you and your birds.."

Since it was my feeder, I waited to complete my hanging cable until I picked the location I wax hanging it. I measured how much cable I needed and then cut it and finished with another loop. I used a cheap aluminum carabeener to secure it. Gifting the feeder? Cut the cable and make a loop at end, just estimate length. You can also use rope, string or heavy fishing leaders ( metal ones ) Or whatever you want. . Gets messy but load up the feeder holes with suet!

"I am very fond of repurposing anything headed for the trash heap as some people may have noticed and here I have an opportunity to salvage a juice carton and give the birds a little snack.. It is easy to do and needs few tools.. I had to replace the early pictures of the completed feeder shown which were inadvertently deleted, so you will see a dramatic difference in colour at one point in the project. I could pretend that I did it on purpose to draw attention to what was happening in that step, but I wont. . I suggest that the feeder be located under some kind of overhand to reduce the amount of moisture that might get in the seeds.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. All you need for this project is a beverage carton with a spout on the top. and a few tools. a ruler. a craft knife. a glue gun and a short piece of waterproof tape. and of course some bird feed. Carefully pry open the sealed flaps at the tope of the box, keeping the screw cap.. Wash the box very well so that there is no trace of juice left in it.. When it is dry, take the ruler and measure about 1 1/2 inches from and parallel to the bottom of the box and score a line for about 3/4 inch from the corner. You do not need to cut through the box at this time. Turn the box over and score another line as above.. Repeat this for all 4 corners. . When all four corners are scored parallel to the bottom of the box, measure up one of the corners 1 1/2 inches fom the score line. Score a line from the end of the score line furthest from the corner up to the nick that you put on the corner to mark 1 1/2 inches up from the score line. Turn the box over and perform this step on the other side of that corner.. Repeat this for all 4 corners.. You may have noticed a slight change in the appearance of the box. The earlier pictures of the feeder were accidentally deleted and so the earlier steps were shown on different box. Sorry if it leads to confusion.. Go over each of your scored lines parallel to the bottom cutting through as smoothly as you can.. Then with you thumbs push the corner of the box inward along the angled scored lines. . I have shown these openings from several angles.. When you have pushed in the 4 openings, refold the top opening and ensure that the cap is in place.. At this point you can fill the feeder with seed.. You will see the top edge of one of the two unfolded edges has a tab on it. Take this tab and insert it into the space between the folded edges and the edge without a tab. While holding it in place, have a friend apply hot glue. Some hot glue does not hold for more than a minute, so a this point quickly apply a strip of waterproof tape on both sides of the top flap. . Now take the bird feeder outside and make some birds very happy. . Because of the cap at the top of the box, you will be able to refill the feeder. I recommend using a funnel to aid in pouring the seed into the box.. Participated in the Outside Contest 2016. Participated in the Makerspace Contest. Participated in the Backyard Contest 2016."
"ok for this i wanted a safe way to stop ants from getting in my Hummingbird, and Suet feeders, yes water works but its hot and dry in the south and it dries out, so i tried essential oils as a barrier, seems to work well. You will need old water or soda bottles. scissors do not run with them!. wire or coat hangers the metal kind.. cotton or some absorbent material to hold oils. some essential oils, peppermint, lemongrass, cedar, etc . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. cut bottom of bottle off save it for later, poke a hole in lid, and in bottom center.pass wire thru. on wire near top add a small wire to hold cotton balls in place. add cotton balls. ok put a few drops of each oil you use on cotton, then push bottom on wire to make a hold and slow evaporation of oils. note you could use a poison but i don't like the thought of that..

"Here's a sweet little birdhouse design that doesn't require a lot of time, tools or materials.
The ""house"" is an empty soda can, making it the perfect size for tiny wrens that enjoy close quarters. The pop top makes a great natural perch and larger birds or predators can't get through the 1 inch ""doorway"" to pester the tiny tweeters. 
Using a spray adhesive, bark and natural moss are glued to the entire surface of the can to provide insulation and camouflage.  
The finished wren house is finally attached to a tree limb using ZIP TIES.
No lumber or nails were used, making this finished birdhouse eco and tree friendly.
This project is FUN and easy-peasy!  Let's get started!. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. The can needs to be clean so it won't attract ants, wasps or other sweet-seeking bugs. Rinse it out thoroughly in hot water
Mark the holes where you need to drill, making sure the doorway and perch are in the right position. 
Using a dremel, drill the holes on both sides of the can where you marked them. Aluminum is soft, but it's also tough and can get a little squirrely.  Control the drill pressure because once the metal gives to the bit, it really GIVES. Be careful and don't let the bit get away from you.
Now push each zip tie through the holes and connect the loose ends temporarily with a piece of tape. This way you won't accidentally cover the holes when you camoflauge the can.
Drill a couple more holes on the bottom for drainage. I hear baby birds are messy and they won't wear diapers.. Spray adhesive is TOUGH.  Used the right way, it'll hold almost anything together. Read the directions on the can before using it.
You might want to use a stick, as pictured, so you don't get the adhesive all over your fingers.
For the best adhesion, spray BOTH surfaces of what you want to glue together. Wait  30- 60 seconds, then press the surfaces together.
In this case, spray the can and spray the bark.  Wait 1 minute and press the bark onto the can. 
Wait another 5-10 minutes for the glue to bond before adding the next piece of bark. Continued until the can is totally covered with bark. Add sprigs of moss and and a few fir twigs or whatever is handy for you. 
I used dry bark and natural moss gathered from my property, but any natural, slow-to-decompose material will work to camouflage the soda can.. I chose a pine that was about 25' tall.
I wanted the birdhouse to be fastened to a limb at least 8' above the ground, so out came the ladder. 
The wind on my mountain usually blows from the North, so I chose a limb that ran North to South.  
As it turned out, the diameter of that limb was too big for one 7"" zip tie, so I connected 2 zip ties together, head to tail.  Problem solved.. The little wren birdhouse is now in place, ready and waiting for a lucky wren husband and wife to move in and start a family.

Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. I used two sheets of 12""x24"" craft plywood 1/8"" thick. Sanded and stained them with Minwax Golden Oak.. Smoothed the finished stain with fine steel wool. . Created a laser cut file for the wood and Plexiglas.. Laser Cut the Wood and Plexi.. Smoothed the edges with fine sandpaper and coated with Polyurethane. . First assemble the Plexiglas pieces using the Plexiglas adhesive. . Coat the edges of both pieces let stand for 30 seconds before attaching. . After holding the pieces together for two minutes apply an additional bead along the edge. The adhesive will fall into and fill the cracks. . Assembly all sides of the Plexi and let stand. . Lay out the wood pieces for assembly after they have thoroughly dried from the Poly. . Use the wood glue, apply a light layer on the inside edges of the grooves before assembly. . I used a Q-tip to apply the light layer as seen in the photographs. . To begin I laid the back side of the birdhouse face down and glued the sides to it, one by one. . As seen in the photographs the pieces fit within one another using the grooves.. I used the wood glue and assembled each piece individually until all the sides were installed.. Lastly for the wood assembly, lay a light layer of glue on all the edges (facing up) already installed. . Install the front face of the birdhouse.. Let the wood assembly dry over night. . The last step is to attach the Plexiglas and Wood to one another. . The Plexiglas contains three L shaped connectors on each side.. These slide into the six holes on the front face of the birdhouse, and down to lock into place.. The last piece is the ""key"" also made of Plexi it is 1/4"" wider than the pool and contains two small teeth.. After sliding the pool down, two small 1/8"" square holes are exposed above the pool from where the L connectors slid in. The key slides into this gap, fills the holes, and keeps the pool from being able to rise. . The clear Plexi is able to hold water if used outside, a source of drinking water or bird bath. . The front edge is 1/2"" shorter than the sides to allow the overflow during rain. . Participated in the Summer Fun Contest 2016. Participated in the Outside Contest 2016.

"If you go on you tube and search for hummingbird bath, you can find a video of humming birds playing in a shallow pan of water with fresh water being circulated by a small pump. Try https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vsXFH0YbZE Not my work but has made Wifey dear want one so she could watch the little birds skim the water and occasionally stop for a real bath. However, she didn't want a power cord stretched out the window so it needed to be solar powered.. I found a small solar powered fountain pump at harbor freight. The same model can be found on amazon and home depot. It only has about a 9 inch lift and that is probably in very bright sun. All I needed is two to three inches of lift so this is sufficient. The model has a solar panel with 16 feet of cord so the solar panel could go on the roof with the bird bath on the ground. The output of the panel is stated to be 1.5 watts at 7 votes. I expect it could be replaced with a small 6 vote lead acid if that was necessary. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. The bird bath consists of two baking pans. A deep one to act as a water reservoir and a shallow one to act as the bird path. I added the solar powered fountain pump, a couple of washers, some 1/2 in outer diameter, 3/8 in inner diameter hose and some hose clamps. Due to the deep pan not being deep enough, I used extra hose to lift the shallow pan up a bit. This was attached with some sealant. Hopefully, the sealant will conform to the edge of the pan and stick. The nonstick coating on the shallow pan was giving me some problems. I may replace it with some self adhesive gasket. The adhesive should stick to the deep pan rim without too much trouble. . The shallow pan fits inside the deep pan and the handles keep it from falling in. Unfortunately the deep pan needed to be a little deeper as the pump was a little higher than I thought. To fix this I glued some of the hose to the bottom of the shallow pan and you will see the tape holding it in place in some of the pictures. Getting a deeper bottom pan would probably be better but wifey dear wanted it today. . Using a 1/2 inch drill I drilled a hole in the handle of the shallow pan. Feeding some of the hose through the hole from the upper side I put the pump adapter on the hose and tightened it down with a hose clamp. The hole was a little tight so the pump is likely going to be lifted with the upper pan when removed for cleaning.. Wifey dear acted as the hand model. . Stretch the hose to the other side of the pan and cut it off about 6 inches past the other side. Drill another 1/2 in hole through the bottom of the pan on that side near the edge. When the hose is pushed through this hole it will essentially be contained by the friction fit of the holes. Double the hose over and tighten a hose clamp over it to close off the end.. To drain the water back into the lower pan, drill a hole in the shallow pan opposite the opening for the pump. Using some sealant, glue two washers over the hole. The thickness of the washers will determine how deep the water will be, assuming the pan is level. . Drill some holes in the hose pointed slightly downwards. Be conservative as you don't want to blast the little birds out of the pan or lose all the water. . Place the deep pan on a surface, fill with water and put the shallow pan on top. You can see I will need to level the surface a bit but having a slight tip may be beneficial to the birds. Just make sure the water will drain back into the lower pan and not out the side. . When you get enough sun the pump will spray some water out the holes in the hose.I was able to get a couple of photos of the action. One around 1pm and another around 6pm. Both show a couple of sprays and some dripping. . Once it is leveled up and running, some decoration can be added to make it prettier. Maybe the bottom pan can be painted and some plants or moss added.. Participated in the Summer Fun Contest 2016. Participated in the Renewable Energy Contest.

"The other day I came across a video on the internet of a hummingbird feeding bar. I immediately thought that was a clever idea. Upon searching for hummingbird bar, I came across these nifty ones from Perky-Pet: http://www.birdfeeders.com/perky-pet-hummerbar-hum...Their feeders cost $19.99 and $29.99. Cool looking, but too expensive. I decided to make my own and I am very happy with the results. This Instructables explains how I made my 2 x 24"" feeding bars (but you may choose to make 1 x 48"" bar instead) for ONLY $12.60.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Materials:- 4 ft. Fluorescent Tube Protector ($3.47). - Epoxy putty ($5.77). - 4 x 15/16"" (#212) Screw Eyes ($1.18 for 8). - Red Nail Polish ($1.00). - 2 x Small S hooks ($1.18). - String (free). - Cork (free). Total Cost: $12.60. Tools:- Rotary tool with cut-off wheel or Hack Saw. - Wide boxing tape or Saran Wrap. - Drill. - Level. - Hole Saw . - Old soldering iron (optional). - Sharpie pen. The tube protector comes with black stoppers on each end.Tape the holes of those stoppers from the outside, then epoxy the inside. Let it set then wash the inside really well a couple of times. . NOTE: Since each tube protector comes with 2 stoppers, you will not be able to use the 2 x 24"" tubes simultaneously unless you procure 2 extra stoppers. I am alternating my tubes. . This is the most intricate part of the whole project.Fill the tube with water almost to the top. Cap it and lay it flat on a level surface. Leave enough air inside for the buble to spread all the way across the tube. The water level will be used to determine where the flower holes will be drilled. . Stabilize the tube so it won't roll. Looking from the side, the water level should be 4/5 of the way up the tube. The 2 flower rows should be about 1"" apart (measured on top following the contour of the tube). Adjust the volume of water inside if needed. . Find the top center of the tube (the equal distance between the ends of the tube and the rows of flowers) and mark an X with a Sharpie pen. That spot will be where you fill the tube. . Mark the mid point of the water line on both rows of flowers with dots. Starting on the water line dots you just created, measure every 1.5 inches on each direction on both sides.. Once both rows are dotted, roll the tube to align the top center X to the water line. Measure 1"" from each end of the tube and mark that spot on the water line. Those marks will be where you hang your feeder from. . Now that you have a tube with 2 rows of leveled dots about 1.5"" apart and X markings on the top center and ends of the tube, it is time to start creating the holes. . I created my feeding holes using an old soldering iron (easier) but you can achieve the same result using a drill. The holes should be around size 3/32. Make holes on each dot you created. For 24"" tubes, that will be 24 feeding holes. . NOTE: Skip the center dots and end dots of both rows.. Using a hole saw roughly the same diameter as the cork, make a hole where the top center X is. The cork should fit snug but does not need to seal. The only purpose of the cork is to keep animals out of your sugar water. . Using a small drill bit, make pilot holes where the top end marks are. Screw in a screw eye on each side. Make sure each side goes in roughly the same depth into the tube. Using the epoxy putty, cover the point of the screw inside the tube. That will make it safer for cleaning and prevent the screw to rust. . Paint each feeding hole with a red flower using the nail polish. The easiest way I found to do this is to make an asterisk using the hole as the center. You may need to do 2 or 3 coats of nail polish until the color is a vibrant red. NOTE: There are other ways of doing this... red stickers, red wire connectors, etc. The key here is durability, easiness to clean, and the color RED!. Next step is to hang your feeder. It needs to be as level as possible. Use the level to accomplish that. I hung mine with screw eyes attached to the ceiling. The screws are about 26 inches apart. That helps to stabilize the back and forth movement of the bar in case of strong winds. I used fishing line to dangle the bar to about 6.5 feet high. S hooks make it easier to hang and remove the feeder for cleaning (every 3 days or so around here... it varies with the ambient temperature. Warmer climates require more frequent cleaning). Use a bottle brush to clean the inside of the feeder.Once your feeding bar is hung, add your HOMEMADE ""nectar"" through the filling hole. A funnel makes that task easier. Cork the filling hole. NECTAR RECIPE: 1 part white granulated cane sugar dissolved in 4 parts of drinking water. Mix the 2 ingredients then heat it up to a rolling boil. Remove from heat and let it cool completely before adding to the feeder. IMPORTANT: Do not use the ready to use red nectar sold in stores. Do not add food coloring to your homemade nectar. . .

"This instructable is how to build a bird feeder from a used tin can and twine. I built this for my mom for her birthday and she absolutely loved it. I works phenomenally and the birds seem to love the twine perch to stand on. To my surprise, you really cant tell it's actually a tin can until you get really quite close, and the twine serves as a great contrast to the metal. This is a design that is versatile enough to fit in any location, and you can change the wrapping material on the outside to make it fit any style.. Materials consist of:. - Tin Can. - Jute Twine. - Scissors. - Razor Knife. - Can opener. - Large Popcicle Stick/ Tongue Depressor. - Hot Glue. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. First you have to prepare the can by removing the labels and using the can opener to cut around half of the lid. Then fold the loose lid back in the can. Make sure to not leave any sharp edges around the rim which might injure or cut the birds in some way. This is why you should not cut off the other half of the lid, and rather fold it, because if it is cut, it exposes a sharp edge which could cause injury to the birds while they eat. . In this step it you need to pick which size of can to use because that will determine some design choices later on. I think it would look really cool to build around 5 or more of all different sizes, and hang them scattered around in a small tree. The rustic twine and the reflections and modern appeal of the tin can would really go nice together, especially on a large scale design.. In this step you have to wrap the can with your twine. You can use thin twine like I used or use twine up to half an inch and have it mimic rope you might find on a dock. This step is where you can determine the overall design and anything from a quaint bird feeder in a rural area, to a rustic style bird feeder near the beach. . I used hot glue to tack it down in the middle of the bottom of the can, and started my wrap there. On the bottom side I had to glue it down in multiple spots each spin, but once I got over to the sides, I was able to tack it down about every 5 turns. Make sure to wrap the twine around the base really tight because the bird feeder will be out in the elements. . After about and inch or so of wraps around the side, make sure to glue your popsicle stick down as a perch for the birds, and wrap around that as well. When I got the the very end of my can, I entirely glued the string down for the last few wraps, and then continued to wrap around the popsicle stick on the bottom. I glued the end of the twine to the tip of the popsicle stick, and added a small length of twine to hang it with.. At this point all you need is to fill it with bird seed and hang it up in your back yard or garden. The birds love it, and even though there is only one perch, the same amount of birds still hang around it. It is a great replacement for our old feeder, and it surely looks a lot better. Another added bonus is it is squirrel proof, and nearly impossible for them to land on the small perch.. This is my first instructable, so thank you very much for viewing it! This is a great project to do over the summer with your kids, and you can teach them about birds, wildlife, and nature. I hope you can use it and make one of your own! . - Brandon, 16 (Modern Rustic Workshop). Runner Up in the Animals in the Wild Challenge. Participated in the Trash to Treasure Challenge.

"This Instructable will show you how to make an easy and inexpensive bird feeder from materials laying around the house. The tea cup and saucer we got for free from a CraigsList curb alert. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Tea cup and saucer. Velcro. E600 (or another strong epoxy/adhesive, OR hot glue with epoxy for added support--something non-toxic). Bird seeds. Before you glue anything down, decide how you want your bird feeder to be set up. We've learned with our own bird, Cecil, that birds won't really dig for seeds, so an upright cup probably won't attract many birds. An easy to peck through layer of seeds, will. . When you've decided on the placement of the cup, use hot glue and/or a strong non-toxic epoxy to cement the pieces in place. Make sure to follow the manufacturer suggestions on how to use exactly. Also make sure to clean up any glue strands etc. so the birds don't accidentally ingest it. . We decided to use velcro to secure the bird feeder because our balcony is a bit oddly put together. Just slap a strip of extra strong velcro to the bottom of your saucer and the other end to where you want your bird feeder to stay and you're good to go. . The bird feeder is going on the window away from our container plants as we've had problems with bird seeds being knocked into the containers and sprouting. . Your local pet and hardware stores will have a variety of seeds, usually ones specific to the birds in your area. We have a mix of wild bird and song bird seeds. . Now that your bird feeder is all set up, sit back and wait for the birds to come. We've been very lucky this summer and have had a wide variety of birds coming to our balcony---we think partially because of the seeds, but also because of our own bird, Cecil. .

"I got the idea of making a bird feeder from the fact that in our area are various birds and this way it is easier to watch them.. It is self-dosing because you can fill the bottle with seeds and turn it upside down and the seeds will flow only when the flower pot saucer will start to get empty.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Materials: . Tools:. First of all, You have to cut down the bottom of the bottle. Thereafter, assemble 2 pieces of wood, I used 3 nails, but You can use screws. This two will be the bottom and the back of the feeder.To attach the bottle, I drilled two holes in the back of the feeder and I placed into 1-1 screw with 1-1 nut and screw washer. Between the nuts and the screw washer I attached the builders tape. This tape will hold the bottle.After placing the bottle (upside down) in the bottle's holder, I made a 'roof' to protect from the rain, for that I used the 3. piece of wood.Finally, I put the flower pot saucer under the bottle, and I filled the bottle up with seeds. . I put the bottom of the bottle into the bottle to avoid birds flying into it - optional.. I found a tall tree at the end of the yard what I think this is the best place for birds feeding.I placed a screw in the upper part of the back (above the roof) for the wire, that I used to wrap around the feeder and the tree..

"This project is not an act of cruelty, but helping/ forcing invasive slugs into the food chain! . In Denmark, where I live, the slugs have invaded the gardens. Not more than 5 years ago, there were hardly any slugs in our garden, but they have come from other countries and keep on laying eggs. They have no natural enemies here and therefore there are now thousands of them in our garden! They are gross, and they eat our vegetables and flowers. When we collected them for this project, ALL of the slugs you see in this picture, were literally found in about 2 m^2 of our garden in about 5 minutes. Gross! . However: Birds, hedgehogs and other animals can eat them! They just don't know, because it is so recently that the slugs have come here. So this is the plan: To teach the birds and hedgehogs to eat them. . What you need: . How it works: Slugs can't swim, and birds and hedgehogs need water. So every time you find a slug, place it on the brick island, and it won't be able to escape! Then when the birds and hedgehogs come to get a drink, they will notice the slugs. And eventually, they will eat them! Once they find out that they can eat them, they will automatically start looking for them other places in your garden! So basically, this is not a cruel way to get rid of your slugs, but a way to help/ force them into the food chain. A lot of people use poison or salt to kill their slugs, but using this method, you are feeding birds and hedgehogs instead, with the same results! . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Even though this is a slug killer, we don't want them to suffer. Therefore you must place the birdbath in a shady place, so they don't dry out in the sun. . Also, as you place the slugs on the brick, make sure that you don't accidentally push them into the water - again, we don't want to make them suffer by drowning. . Place the brick in the middle of the birdbath. Make sure that the brick doesn't touch the birdbaths edges, so the slugs can't escape. Now fill it up with water! Put just about 3 - 5 cm (1,1 - 2 inches) water in the birdbath, no more. This is because we don't want hedgehogs to drown. The poor bastards aren't that smart ;) . Snails are harmless, so please don't put them on your island. These small fellas are just chilling out in your garden, and you don't want to hurt them. It is only the invasive slugs we want to keep down! . As I said before, there are A LOT of slugs in our garden! . ALL of the slugs on these pictures, were found approximately inside the red line I drew on the picture, in about 5 minutes! It is completely out of hand... . Just use a trowel to pick up the slugs and place them onto the brick island, but be careful not to harm them. . Like I said before: This project is not an act of cruelty, but helping/ forcing invasive slugs into the food chain! . Now all you have to do, is to wait. It probably wont work the first day, but in about a week, it should be starting to work! . Now all you have to do, is to look out for slugs to place on the island, so that there are always a bunch on the brick. If you do this once daily, it should be enough! . Good luck with your invasive slugs, I hope this will work for you, as it is for me and my mother! :) . Runner Up in the Animals in the Wild Challenge. Participated in the Outside Contest 2016."
"Hi. Welcome to my birdhouse. This is my first own building project and I'm not a native speaker so please excuse any misspelling. Have fun.. Tubebird. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. First you need wood. Much wood. I used this wooden board. Then I sawed the wooden board in little parts. Two with 40cm x 12 cm and two with 13cm x 12cm. Then I filed the corners with sandpaper. . On the bottom line of one of the long boards I drilled three holes size 3. The edge of the second board was attached to this using some old screws. . Next I drill a hole in the first side and in the other side only a pit. I have to widen the pit. Next I took a rocket stick and put it through the hole.. Now I saw the next board with 46cm x 12cm. On the bottom side I drilled five holes. Second I hold the plank aslope and fix it with screws. Before this I already sawed too small boards so I have to fix it in two part, but it`s aslope again for keep away the rain. . Finaly I used foil to make the house rain save. With a tacker I attached it to the wood. Next I cut the overlaying foil.. Now just put the apples on the stick and wait for the birds. You should drill the apples before sticking them.. I hope you enjoyed my instructable. Questions and comments are welcome and please vote for me cause I want a T-shirt. 8-). Thanks Tubebird. ;). Participated in the Outdoor Structures Contest.

"What if your pigeon could transfer a message, a USB disk or even a mobile phone (or camera). Your dreams can now become true!!!. What is a homing pigeon?(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homing_pigeon). The homing pigeon is a variety of domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica) derived from the rock pigeon, selectively bred for its ability to find its way home over extremely long distances. The wild rock pigeon has an innate homing ability,meaning that it will generally return to its nest, using magnetoreception. This made it relatively easy to breed from the birds that repeatedly found their way home over long distances. Flights as long as 1,800 km (1,100 miles) have been recorded by birds in competitive pigeon racing. Their average flying speed over moderate[clarification needed] distances is around 80 km/h (50 miles per hour) but speeds of up to 140 km/h (90 miles per hour) have been observed in top racers for short distances.. Because of this skill, homing pigeons were used to carry messages as carrier pigeons or messenger pigeons. They are usually referred to as ""pigeon post"" or ""war pigeon"" during wars.. Teachers!

"This Instructable will show how to make a gravity feed bird feeder from some salvaged PVC pipe, cheap and forgotten Frisbee, and a few PVC plumbing fixtures.. Last Cedar and Plexiglas bird feeder (A Gift) met it's demise after about 15 years of long cold winters and hot humid summers. Still useful and intact is the post and squirrel baffle.. I could not bring myself to pay $30-$40 for another feeder, so had to figure out a way to make a new one at a fraction of the cost.. Due to the materials and tools I already had, total cost for this project to me was about $14.. The concept comes from a deer feeder I built some years ago..

Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. This really is a simple (relative to the tools you have) project with minimal supplies needed.. These are the tools I used, but I am sure you can can make things happen with some other basic tools you have handy. NOTE: For the vertical cuts of the notches I used the flush cut saw, then used the 1/8 inch drill bit to drill a series of holes for the horizontal line. I kept working the drill with holes until the notch came out. Hacksaw or some other cutting tool could work too.. Pretty simple... Drill a 1/8 inch hole in center of cap and insert screw and knob.. NOTE: Thickness of PVC is about 1/4 inch. I had to cut my screw down about a 1/4 inch to ensure a snug and tight fit.. Dry fit everything together. If there are any modifications you want to make, then do them now before priming.. NOTE: That object to the right of the feeder is the mount that will be attached to the bottom of the feeder after priming and painting. That part will insert into the post and baffle unit That will be the last item attached before placing on the post. . Painting your bird feeder. After about 24 hours to let your primer coat cure, get the paint colors of your choice. We used an exterior latex paint. Again, extra paint we had stored in the cabinet from another project.. This mounting plate came with the post and squirrel baffle. I simply salvaged it from the old bird feeder that met it's demise.. Looking for feedback on different types of bird feed. I pretty much buy the best deal available.. If you like, please vote Animals in the Wild contest and Outside contest.. Participated in the Outside Contest 2016.

"Bats will travel for km's for finding food, especially fruit bats. . Buildings and concrete have forced the bats to move out of the cities. This small creature has a lot to offer and we should help it in anyway we can. . This is an instructable for building a simple nest for the bats i have flying round my house. I believe its a good idea to keep them around. They help a lot in controlling the number of small insects, especially mosquitoes. . The aim is to built a small, cheap, light-proof box. (is light-proof a word?)The idea is for the bat to be able to grab on the mesh wire and walk / climb her way up inside the nest.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. No special tooling needed. A sharp hand saw, and a screwdriver or hummer will do the job but any other electric tools are welcome :). I used a miter saw, a band saw, a drill and a nail gun.. The material to be used is wood and fine mesh wire. No glue and no paint/varnish is needed. For my prototype, i will use scrap osb wood. It is light, weather proof and free. The osb was part of an old dog-house from a neighbor.The mesh wire is taken from an old cooker hood.. For the final product, i will use 8mm marine plywood.. Measure twice, cut once. These are the parts dimensions and the parts transferred on the osb. Make sure you do straight cuts. Upon assembly, the light must be kept out, so a firm straight joint is necessary. The piece i had was 52x63cm, which was more than enough.. These are the parts cut. The saw dust aids in visual drama :). Time to put the pieces together. Can be either screwed or nailed. Either way, keep it simple.I used nails for this attempt.. First nail the two sides and in between nail the mesh wire. Then the front, the roof and the bottom lid. Finally, the long piece behind it for hanging/fastening.. This is the finished prototype. . This is the final design. I used 8mm marine plywood and tried to give some optical beauty to the nest. Hope to be more attractive to the bats :). I miter cut the pieces for a better fit, used hinges for the bottom lid (helps the observation) and fastened the mesh wire on three wood rails. This way, there is a space between the wire and the rear flat. Also, a series of small holes on the front help the air circulation.. Hope you liked it and more important, i hope you built one outside your house. Bats need a good home :). Runner Up in the Animals in the Wild Challenge.

"Natural cavities are rare where I live. Old bricks are removed & replaced by concrete, aluminium & pvc, old trees are removed & replaced by exotic species & bamboo, old people are removed - also - & replaced by younger specimens, electronic devices, labradors & portable bbq's.. Like I said before, it's really hard being a cavebird these days. . This spring we added a lot of bird houses in our garden, but despite all those efforts we couldn't avoid civil wars between species. A couple of Starlings killed 6 young Great Tits to pirate the house they were in, for example, and Wrens are nesting in the balcony nests of Barn Swallows.. Pressure is on, and so to avoid these dramas, we decided to change to another level & drown the local real estate market.. More boxes, at minimum cost & effort.. Like always, the solution was in the beer.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Since the time we arrived in Northern France, I'm keeping all those beer kegs aside - to use them later, you know.. For what it's worth: I didn't empty them all on my own. I think.. Yes I used one to make a safety helmet, but that makes thus minus one from the pile of shame growing in my workshop.. Thanx to the birds, I finally found a decent idea to reduce the waste, ànd to continue the drinking.. 'Our birdz are in the need, you know' I said to my wife. 'I'll build them houzez, màààààààny houzez!'.. So, for this project you'll need such a steel beer keg. Or more than one.. Advantage: those kegs are leightweight, sealed and have a reasonable useful volume inside.. Depending on the species you want to favorise, you'll need to drill the right entrance hole.. Knowing that the edges of freshly cut beer keg steel are razorsharp, I decided to insert pvc covers.. So, use a clock drill to cut the hole in the side - diameter: same as the outside diameter of this pvc cover.. Btw, it's not the cover itself in which I was interested, but the ring - of course.. Remove the external hardware & drill a big hole in the top of the keg.. Diameter: as wide as the pvc cover you'll be using. . I choose 80mm covers, since it's just the biggest clock drill I have.. Like in every house building project, after the rough work it's time for some plumbry.. Take the entrance cover, cut a ring from a connection, insert the cover in the keg & glue the ring from the inside to the backside of the cover to seal that ring nice in place.. For what it's worth: the edges of the maintenance hole are razorsharp, also, so ask a child to glue the ring in place. Children have smaller hands than you. And they heal faster, also.. I had the chance having drilled a maintenance hole that was just a tiny bit smaller that the bigger pvc cover I wanted to use, and so the last could be just pushed in place.. No risk that it will run away from its own. Or that it will be pushed out by a bird. Even not a very strong bird.. The only way to remove it, in fact, is by an exploding bird.. Interesting suject.. Like every house, also this one needs to be isolated.. Steel is nice conductive material, you know, and to prevent thermal loss, thermal bridges, undercooled baby birds & condensation on the walls, I inserted a roll of cardboard in the keg & spent 15 minutes to poke it to the sides of the keg. Yep, thàt's why the top hole was made so big... Once in place, a nice layer of wood chips was brought in to prevent the cardboard from moving ànd to isolate the floor.. Since this operation closed the entrance again, I drilled it out, again, with the right clock drill & added some elmers glue to keep the hole more or less immobile. Dirty, but effective.. 5 or six layers of cardboard closed the roof and ready was the device.. I didn't need a waterproof cover for this one since it went straight into our barn, but if you want to use these devices outside a roof won't be a luxury. Imagination, it's all yours.. Place it high & place it dry. Avoid direct access to predators like cats - or stupid drunken sailors - and try to have a large fly-zone just in front of it. . The more bird houses you'll be adding, the more choice you'll give to those birds. Make big entrances & small ones. Small birds can use boxes with big entrances but small birds will be chased by big birds if big birds don't find what they need elsewhere. Birds logic, deadly effective.. Entrances needs to be directed opposite to the prevailing wind direction. It's not funny when rain chases inside and you need to grow at least two more weeks to be able to leave the cradle.. Let's drink for a better world my friends, the birds need our help!. Runner Up in the Animals in the Wild Challenge."
"This is a step by step instructable on how to make a birdhouse. . You will need: . Finishing nails . 3/8"" Plywood . Wire . Wide head screws . Tools: . Hammer . Saw . Measuring tape . Pen (Not really a tool!) . Screwdriver . Drill. 1 1/4"" or 1 1/8"" hole saw. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. There are 7 pieces to this birdhouse: the floor, the walls (4 pieces), And the roof (2 pieces).. Cut dimensions as written: . Floor (#1) 4"" x 4"" . Side Walls (#2 & 3) 4"" x 8"" . Roof Side Left (#6) 4 3/8"" X 6"". Roof Side Right (#7) 4 3/4"" X 6"". Front & Back (#4 & 5) Shown in next step.. The front and back of the birdhouse overlaps the sides, therefore making the front and back 4 3/4"" wide. Cut your plywood to 4 3/4"" x 10 3/8"". On one side of the plywood, Mark the middle of the board. (2 3/8"") . If you are using a miter saw, all you need is photos one and four. . If you are using a hand saw, after you have marked the middle of the board, measure 2 3/8"" down on each side. mark from the middle to these lines. (Photo 2) . These are perfect 45º angles. Next, cut the board 8"" from the bottom of where the roof would be, (At the bottom, where the eaves would be.) Cut two of these.. On piece number 4 or 5, make a mark 6"" from the bottom, and in the very middle. (Of course! Who wants an uneven hole?) Drill it with a 1 1/4"" or 1 1/8"" hole saw.. Nail side wall #2 onto floor #1. (Picture 1) You can see how it will stand. . Nail the front wall onto the side of pieces #1 & 2. If you want to do it like my instructions, have the side wall to the right.. Nail the back wall on (#4), the same way as the front.. Make a mark at 7 1/2"" (From the bottom) on the front and back walls, on the left side. this will mark where to put your hinges (Nails) on. Put your board in place, and clamp it on. Nail it on, and test to see how well it opens and closes. If your nails are not at the same height, your opening side will not open straight. . Next, at the bottom left of of the front, put a nail in about halfway in. Next, bend it until it almost touches your opening side. this will keep it closed. You can turn the nail to get the side open.. First, nail the #6- 4 3/8"" x 6"" roof board onto the left side. (It doesn't matter, but I wanted to say a side.). Nail the #7- 4 3/4"" x 6"" board onto the other side, overlapping the other one by 3/8"".. You don't have to hang your birdhouse, you can also screw it to a tree or a fence post.. Screw in one screw each on the front and back, right where the two roof boards meet. Cut 2' of wire and wrap it under each of the screws. Screw in the screws, and hang it! .

"Years ago, my husband brought home a stack of metal spools used to store MIG wire. He sewed wire cloth onto the spool in a somewhat rudimentary fashion, and called it a bird feeder. A raccoon demolished it, the spool was chunked into a pile, and that was the end of that. Fast forward a few years, and I found myself with a backyard that had become a bird oasis. It seemed like a good time to drag out the old feeder and give it an overhaul. The result is a large feeder that is very durable, can be painted, easily filled, will feed many birds at once, and will also last a very long time. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Gather the following materials for your feeder: 1 large metal spool (mine is a 12"" spool) These spools are typically used to hold MIG welding wire, but can also be used to hold other wire. Check with local welding supply stores. Any welder should be able to steer you toward a pile of these spools, free of charge. 1 roll of hardware cloth You will need enough cloth to cover the front, back, and circumference of the edge of the spool. A 10' x 3' roll will cover almost nine 12"" spools.1 roll of galvanized steel wire (I used 24 gauge, with a 10 pound work load)A short length of chain that can be shortened, used to hang the feederThe following tools are necessary, if not very helpful: Sheet metal scissors Felt-tip pen such as a SharpieDurable hand protection, such as leather glovesNeedle-nosed pliersWire cuttersA tool with a tiny hook on it, such as a small latch-hook or crochet hookOptional: Spray paint. Unroll the wire fabric on a flat surface. You may wish to use gloves at this time, to protect your hands from scratchescaused by the wire. Place the empty MIG spool on the wire, then trace around the outer edge in order to draw the size you will need to sew the fabric to the spool. Repeat, making two circles. Place the spool on its side, at a straight edge of the fabric. Using the Sharpie, mark the width that will be required. Holding the fabric against the spool, roll the spool and the wire in a completewheel rotation in order to determine the length. You can also simply use a tapemeasure. It all works, right? Be sure to leave a gap in the side length in order tofill the feeder. Keep in mind, the gap should be small, to avoid birds getting stuckinside the feeder. You might also consider closing the gap, then creating a hole that is large enough for a funnel tip to fit into, for filling. Once you have drawn the two circles, and one long rectangle, use the sheet metalscissors to cut out the shapes. . Place the spool on a flat work surface. Lay one of the wire mesh circles on top of it, and secure the circle to the spool with temporary ties. You may use small pieces of wire, trash / bread ties, etc. Align the side wire to the side of the spool, using temporary ties to secure it. You may wish to combine a tie to secure both pieces of wire in the same place. It is not necessary to make multiple ties, but do make certain the pieces will notmove around while you are stitching the edges. . Using a length of wire, secure it to the spool by twisting, or even wrapping it around the spool wire a few times. You may then begin stitching, just as if you were sewing clothing with a whip stitch. It is not necessary to place a stitch into every single 1/4"" space, but do sew the stitches close enough so bird food will not fall out. Pull the wire taut, using needle-nosed pliers, to save your fingers. I found it easier to not use gloves during the stitching process. You will not be using a needle to sew in the traditional sense, but rather will rely on the stiffness of the wire to act as the needle. It is difficult to guide the wire exactly where you want it to sew, which is where the hook tool will come in handy, to pull it through the 1/4"" squares. Don't use a piece of wire that is excessively long, as it will tangle, bend and get in the way. No more than a yard's length is easier to work with than a lengthy amount. Stitch through the top screen, go through the spool, then exit the outer mesh. Repeat this process all the way around the spool. If you encounter sharp bits of wire edge, you can crimp them down with a tool, or press them with a gloved hand. Don't worry about imperfections, as they can be hidden by spray paint. Also keep in mind, you should press or trim any sharp edges of the wire, to avoid harming our feathered friends. See the next step for additional stitching tips. . Image #1:Needle-nosed pliers will save your fingers, especially after all the stitching that will be necessary. Image #2:If you run out of wire, simply wrap a strand around the spool, or twist it onto the previous wire, and continue stitching. Image #3:Not all of the holes will be complete. No need to worry, simply stitch into the nearest hole that is secure. Image #4:These little sticky-outties are dangerous for both humans and birds. Be sure to either fold them down, and include them in the stitching, or snip them off, making certain to press the sharp edges down with a tool. Image #5:Occasionally, all that yanking on the wire, and a crimp now and then, will cause the wire to break. Simply wind the remainder onto the spool, add a new piece of wire, then continue. Image #6:There are several options to end a short piece of wire, including this one. Just run the remaining length along the spool, then stitch over the tail of the previous wire.. You're halfway finished at this point. Flip the spool over, place theremaining piece of wire on top, and begin stitching in the same mannerused for the other half. I find it is easiest to complete this project whenworking at waist level, especially in a brightly lit area. . Once you have completed the stitching process, be sure to crimp downany sharp edges. You may now add a way to hang the feeder. I just dug through an old junk drawer, and found a short length of chain. Using two pair of pliers, open alink on one end of the chain, then secure it to the wire of the spool, and closethe link. Select the length of chain you desire, open the end link, secure to thespool, and close the chain. You could also use string, rope, or other hanging material, though it would be bestto select something that is durable, and able to withstand the elements of nature. . Once your feeder is complete, and hanging, you may want to give it a good mist of spray paint. This will not only protect the feeder, but will reducethe sharpness of any wires you may have missed. Gotta protect those littlebirdy feet, you know. It is easiest to suspend the feeder while painting, so you can access all ofthe angles at one time. Be sure to let the paint dry thoroughly before adding bird food. . This particular MIG wire spool is rather large, and as a result, holdsa lot of bird food. If you have quite a bird population as we do, don't worry about the food mildewing, but if you only have a few visitors, tryto find a smaller spool, then you can hang many of them. . In our area, the Cardinal population is quite large, so we tend to fill thefeeders with black oil sunflower seeds, though there are other choices.Just be certain the seeds are not too small, such as Nyjer / Niger Thistle (Guizotia abyssinica) seed, or too large, such as striped sunflower. We have many other visitors to the feeders, including: CardinalRed-Wing BlackbirdHouse WrenSparrowTufted TitmouseOccasional BluejayOccasional Indigo BuntingChickadeeUninvited StarlingBe sure to hang a Thistle sock near your feeder, to attract the Purple and Golden Finch. ."
"Using a spotting scope is great fun but you may want to record what you see. I have been digiscoping before with my DSLR camera. It is fun but requires a lot of logistics. When the camera changes focus the lens moves. This greatly complicates the mechanism as I had to build rails to keep the camera aligned with the telescope. I took apart a tripod and used the legs as my slides. The coupling to the scope was sewer fitting with hose clamps. Because of the weight and bulk it was not stable on a tripod. I sewed a sand bag that I placed on the rear deck of the canoe. Next I beached the canoe, laid on a pad in the hull and operated the camera. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. What I really have been lusting for is one of those giant lenses you see all the professionals use on their DSLR. The Nikon lens is $9,995.00 not a toy I will ever own. . Our modern cell phones take reasonable pictures. It seems a natural to marry the two together. This is not a new idea as there are adapters on the market to couple the two. The problem is they want my hard earned money for these and none of them allow you to use your waterproof case that I like to keep my iPhone in.. My friend suggested coupling a telescope and cell phone you could name it a, ""TELEPHONE."". Of course you will need a cell phone, telescope and good tripod. The adapter I crafted used some scrap wood, a hose clamp, a left over scrap of metal with a 1/4 X 20 bolt and knurled knob, scrap of PVC 2"" pipe, two screws and a spring cell phone holder. Optional gear is a protective case for the cell phone, ear buds, adapter cable, sport bag and closed cell foam for transportation. . The further the item being viewed the more camera movement matters. Using the volume switch on the ear buds works as a shutter release. Since the cell phone is in a waterproof case it is necessary to screw in a cable to attach the ear buds. . Like most projects this evolved as I used it. I needed to have the phone offset to the right and up to make the camera lens line up with the eye piece on the telescope. The pictures explain it better than a few thousand words. . Build an L bracket of wood screw on the metal strap, Attach the wood with a pipe strap to the scope. Mount the scrap metal (old flash bracket for an SlR) to the L bracket. Use the bolt to attach the cell phone clamp. This will depend on the shape of your camera, tripod, and cell phone.. I am totally impressed with how much fun this is. Indulge me as I show some images I took on the waterfront. You may have to look close to see the item when photographed with a normal lens.. The original bracket had to be adjusted such that the cell phone clamp did not push the volume button. I had not realized when held down the shutter takes a series of rapid pictures. This also prevented from using the ear bud's low volume as a shutter release.. The long distance in fog increases the fuzz of the image.. Keeping the tripod steady and using a time lapse will improve the image quality. Notice the island has seals hauled out on the beach. Zooming in with the telescope eye piece also reduces image quality. . To eliminate the vignetting you can zoom in with the phone. This does reduce the image quality as it does a digital zoom.. The second adaption was to clamp the phone tight to the eye piece. I carved a short section of 2"" PVC pipe with my band saw and a utility knife. I cut an arch and slit in the scrap of PVC pipe to make a custom clamp.. The great thing about the tripod telescope and cell phone is it is so easy to pack it flat. The quick disconnect was used on the scope and the bracket for the phone stays attached to the scope. The phone can be used while setup on the telescope. Even the front looking selfie camera can be used, since the clamps are out of the way. The entire package quickly fits in a sport bag with a shoulder strap. . You've got to build one of these. Keep me posted of your changes to this fun idea. . Even if you don't build one you can vote for this project. LOL. . Click here for the link.. This is my latest version. I used a monocular, bulldog clamp and a book end along with some plastic clips and some bolts. It is not as powerful a telescope but is much more portable. The book end protects the monocular from touching the bottom of my canoe when I lay it down while attached to the tripod. The wide end provides a rest that keeps it stable from turning over in a rocking boat. . I find this very portable I was able to use the monocular without the iphone. Then I put little pieces of foam to index the phone to the eyepiece. When in place I clip it on with the clamp. The hardest part was bending the book end at the perfect places. I used a metal nibbler to cut out so the buttons would be easy to push. . The normal view with the phone has the river bag in the foreground and the tall ship in the background.. The next shot is close up with the ship and the last one is a zoomed version of the Hawaiian Chieftain.. . Participated in the Flat Pack Contest."
Two incredibly easy DIYs to make using old tea cups! . **Check out the FULL TUTORIAL ABOVE**. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Tea Cup. Block of vegetable shortening. String. Small metal washer. Essential oil . Tea (optional). Scissors. Wooden stick (or pencil). Pot. Tie the end of a piece of string to your metal washer (this helps weigh the wick down). Melt down desired amount of vegetable shortening. Add essential oil (make this as strong or weak as you like) I added about 1 teaspoon. Open and add tea bag (optional) It adds a little extra sent. Pour melted contents into tea cup. Drop the wick in (the washer will bring it to the bottom). Wrap the remainder of the wick around a wood stick or pencil that can stretch across the top of the cup. Centre your wick and let it harden and cool . Trim wick once candle has set. Tea cup and saucer. Old necklace or chain. E6000 glue. Tape. Place a line of glue along the teacup. Glue it to the saucer with the handle facing up. Tape in place and let it dry overnight. Remove tape. String necklace/chain through the handle. Hang on tree or post outside and fill with bird seed.
"Well, as you can see I made a birdhouse this spring and if you like it, too, you're welcome to make one yourself :). You'll need:. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. At first you have to cut the Wood and Glass Parts. I attached the .svg-files, everything you'll need is in them.Red Lines: CutBlack Lines: Engrave. The next step is a little bit tricky. This will be the ""backdoor"" where you can open the birdhouse to clean it after the birds left. I used magnets here, because, well I had some magnets here and I liked the idea.. You'll have to drill some holes for the magnets in the two wood parts as you can see in the image.Be careful not to drill completely through the wood!. Afterwards you can glue the magnets in the holes. Be careful again to place the poles in the right direction!. So now it's time to glue everything together. I think it should be clear, which part belongs where. Also you can see it in the pictures :). When the glue is dry (2-3 days later) you should glaze the outside of your birdhouse with woodstain. I made 3 layers and waited 1 day inbetween each time to let it get dry.. Now it's ready. You can attach some hooks for hanging it up, otherwise you can attach a stick on the bottom to set it up in your garden.. Maybe I will upload some fotos of the glazed, finished birdhouse.. Have fun :). Participated in the First Time Author Contest 2016."
"I like getting creative with my birdhouses. It's a lot of fun watching a bird fly into something amusing. This time I made one that looks like a SawStop table saw. I call it the SawSquawk. Check out the video then follow this Instructable to make one yourself.. Click here to read my blog post on this project and download my cutting templates.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Cut a bottom that is 5"" square. Drill holes in the bottom for air flow and drainage (ew). . Cut two 7""x10"" boards for the front and back. Use the front side cutting template to cut the entry hole. I used a scroll saw, but a jigsaw or coping saw would work too. (I like how the blade tilt crank slot is the hole. LOL). Cut two sides that are 5.5""x10"". . Use glue, nails, and/or screws to put these together to make a 10"" tall box.. Cut a 9"" x 14"" board for the top. To make it look like a table saw, cut two shallow grooves that are about 3/8"" wide for the miter slots. They should be placed about 1/3 from each end of the board.. Paint the table top gray, then mask off the ""insert plate"" area using the template and paint it red. I use paper towels to cover the rest of the table top.. I cut two wooden brackets with mounting holes, then glued and nailed them to the sides of the box. Make sure they are flush with the top of the box. Center the the top and screw it on through the mounting brackets. Make sure your screws are short enough so they don't stick through the top.. This is the fun part...accessorizing your table saw birdhouse! Don't skimp on this part because it really makes the birdhouse look like a table saw. I provided templates for some of these parts, but you will just have to WING the others! ;) Get detailed and be patient!. Cut two cranks, paint them, and screw them on. I placed a nut between the crank and box, and left them a little loose so they can spin. (These can work as a perch for birds, even though perches are not actually recommended, since they help predators get into the birdhouse.). Cut the power button. I also cut a small block that I could use to attach the button. (If you look at a picture of a SawStop, you can see what I was trying to emulate.). Cut and paint the saw blade and riving knife. Glue them so they are centered on the red ""insert plate"".. Make a miter gauge and fence for the table top and paint them like the SawStop. I glued mine in place, but you could leave them loose. People who see my birdhouse always try to move them, so that's a fun option.. Note: I used wood glue to attach the parts. Normally it's not a good idea to use wood glue on painted surfaces, but I've found it works well on signs and things like this that will not be under stress or load.. I recommend painting the logos on if you will be placing the birdhouse outside. Paint pens might be a good way to do this. Another option would be to get vinyl or weather resistant stickers. I will be keeping this birdhouse indoors so I can display it at woodworking shows, so I simply printed the logos on paper and attached them with spray adhesive. (I may go back and paint the logos when I have time.). If you place your birdhouse outside, put it about 5' or 6' off the ground on a fence or tree so that you can see it out of a window. I put birdhouses in locations that I can see from my dinner table. Look at the birdhouse occasionally to see if there is any activity. If not, try moving it to a different spot.. With any luck, you will be grinning when you see a bird fly into your table saw birdhouse. Don't forget to clean it out after the birds leave the nest, so that new residents can move in.."

"What is a view-sight and why might you want one for your camera?. I invented the term ""view-sight"", so no wonder you never heard of one. It's that pointy thing on top of my camera in the photo. I made it because the camera I recently bought did not come with a view finder, only a LCD screen. This camera has a 30x optical zoom, and I planned to use it for bird photography. But most wildlife photographers prefer a viewfinder because it helps them focus on the subject. In addition, a LCD screen can be hard to see in bright sunlight. Let's just say I may have bought the wrong camera for bird photography, because I have been having a terrible time finding the bird on the LCD screen when using zoom. But the camera has great features otherwise, so I decided to see what I could do to remedy the situation.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. My goal was to design something that would help me quickly focus on a distant bird with the camera zoomed out at up to 30x. Also, it had to be simple and compact, because I chose this camera so I could carry it in my pocket, rather than hauling around a large DSLR camera and telephoto lenses. . Doing some research, I found there were magnifying lenses for the LCD screen, also electronic sighting devices, available for otherwise good small cameras without viewfinders. I wasn't too impressed with what I found, and besides, ""if you can make it, why buy it?"".. I began thinking about the simple gun sights used on rifles. They are fairly accurate without resorting to electronics or telescopic sights.. You can see the final product on the intro photo. A magnet holds the brass sighting device onto a small square of steel that is glued to the top of the camera. This way you can easily remove the sight whenever you want to.. Three components make up the view-sight, they are made from:. Brass strip, 1/4"" x 1/32"" thick.. 1/2"" rare earth magnet.. 3/4"" x 1/8"" thick steel bar.. Also glue and black paint. . Everything is available at your local hardware store. . The sight itself is made from a 2-1/2"" length of brass strip. I bent about 3/8"" of each end up, then used a triangular file to make a V notch on one upturned end and a point on the other. Brass cuts nicely.. The brass sight should fit snugly into a groove in the 3/4"" wide steel bar. First I cut off a 1"" long piece of the steel bar with a hack saw. Next came the only difficult part of the project, making a shallow 1/4"" wide groove into the small steel piece. Holding it in a vice, I marked the outline of the groove with a sharp knife. Then I used small files to cut the groove. Make sure the brass sight fits snugly into the groove. I painted the steel piece with flat black spray paint.. The steel piece will be glued to the top of the camera directly over the lens; but do not glue it just yet. You can see where I put it on my camera, it may be different on yours. Just be sure it is not covering or interfering with any of the controls. . Glue the magnet to the top of the brass sight, about in the middle. Shiny rare earth magnets are difficult to glue; I suggest lightly sanding the contact surfaces of both parts, then use epoxy. Glue these pieces first and let the glue harden before going to the next step.. Now you can glue the steel piece to the camera. . Use a silicone based adhesive like E6000. This is the last step; after the glue is applied but still not set, align the sight with the image in the LCD screen. Put a drop of adhesive on the bottom of the steel piece and set it, with brass sight and magnet attached, onto the camera. Then align the sight with a distant object; at the same time align the camera, in zoom mode, so that the object is in the center of the viewfinder. I did this by focusing upon a small light at about 30 ft. distance.. I'll be testing it out for a while before I consider it a success. . So far it has been a help, especially for finding birds in trees.."
"Save the bird-skulls from serious smacks! Birds often mistake the reflection off our window glass for clear skies. Head-first collisions kill thousands of birds every year. Those of us who put out feeders may create an even more strike-prone situation, unless we provide birds with a visible barrier they know they can't fly through. I've seen a number of ways to alert birds to the presence of a window so that they don't fly into it, but most seem to be more visible than I'd like. Taping bird-netting over the exterior of the window provides them with a visible barrier, and me with an unobstructed view of the visitors to my feeder. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. You will need: . You'll be blocking the window from easy cleaning, and I'm not fond of having to take the treatment down and put it back up on a frequent basis. I use Rain-X to give it a stain-resistant coating. (Once upon a time, there was an even better product called ""Glass Wax,"" but I haven't been able to find it in many years.) It'll last through up to a year of rain without needing to be washed, because the rain beads off so well that it leaves no water-marks. Bird-poop can be washed off with a hose or a hard squirt with water from a spray-bottle; if it's dried on, you might be able to dislodge it by wetting it, allowing the water to soak in, and then blasting it with water. . Bird netting is usually used to protect fruiting bushes, vines, and trees from hungry birds. It's made of fine-filament plastic, with a mesh-size of between 1/2"" and 1"" (1 - 2.5 cm). Even the smallest package of netting is probably sufficient for a large patio door, but check your dimensions before purchase. . I find that I can't really see the netting from a distance, unless I specifically focus in on it. I have had only one bird-strike since I put the netting up, and it was a low-speed impact. ( Drunken bird? ) Other ways to help protect the birds is to make sure that the feeders are within three feet (one meter) of the glass--if birds do mistakenly fly at the glass, they won't have built up much speed before the impact. ."
"During the first week of May each year all my classes do watercolor painting for Mother's Day. Sadly no one is in school this spring so I am teaching my Mother's Day Watercolor from my home to theirs.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Watercolor Paper. Watercolors. brushes. pencil. masking tape. cup for water. sponge. vase of flowers for inspiration (even a photo of a flower arrangement will work). Tape the paper to a flat surface. It is important to tape the paper and not remove the tape until the paper is completely dry. Watercolor paper stretches the it gets wet (you will see in later photos) It shrinks back to its flat shape as it dries. If you remove the tape when it is wet it will dry rippled instead of flat.. Next LIGHTLY draw a vase shape. . Using the largest brush you have, wet the entire back ground of the paper, trying hard to avoid getting any water in the vase shape. . Keep that space as dry as possible.. Using that same large brush, make a puddle of paint with the watercolors. You want it very light to represent the ""air"" around the vase and create your background. More colors can be added as you work on the painting, however, be aware of the colors you use. If too many colors are mixed on the paper they may begin to turn muddy. I stay away from Black and Brown for my ""air"" Also I try not to use too much green because I know I will be using green in my flower design. . If there are large puddles on the painting they can be blotted a bit with a damp, clean, sponge. . Because we left the vase shape was left white it represents clear glass . You can see the stems inside the vase. . Using a smaller brush, make a puddle in the green watercolor paint. Starting at the bottom of the vase paint a stem coming out the top. Paint as many stems as you like. . Paint the flowers either by looking at your reference, or just make up your own. This watercolor technique that I teach my students is very spontaneous . The colors will mix together on their own and create lovely transparent patterns. I ask that they don't labor too long over the painting because it will begin to get dark and muddy. Sometimes less is more!. It is hard to see from these photograph, but I want you to notice the paper is very wet now and rippled under the tape. It is very important to let the painting dry completely before removing the tape. I generally leave the paintings over night. . When your painting is completely dry remove the tape. I love the little white edge created by the masking tape. . Happy Mother's Day....This will surely be one to remember!. This is an entry in the Work From Home Speed Challenge."
"Make an interactive way to help students learn the functions of Scratch coding blocks.. You will be creating a push switch glossary that describes the functions of five Scratch blocks: hat, stack, boolean, reporter, and c-blocks. When some of the switches are pushed, they will play two different recording of the functions of that Scratch shape block. Other switches will only play one. Read on to find out why!. 5 - 1"" inch binder clips. 5 - large paper clips (2 in). scotch tape. 10 alligator clips. 1 Makey Makey. small cardboard rectangles (1 1/2 x 2 1/2 in). cardstock or paper. computer (to access Scratch editor). Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Print the Scratch block shape description sheet here. You may wish to print the sheet on cardstock to make it sturdy. You can use the shape block names (in the first row of the table) to label the switches.. You will be recording yourself reading the functions of each shape block in Scratch.. Go to the Scratch website here.. Go to the sounds tab. You will record yourself reading the functions for each shape block. You can name each recording ""hat1, hat2, stack1, stack2"" etc.. Name each recording to match the shape block.. Enter this code in Scratch.. You may test the code with the keys on your computer.. DISCLOSURE: I am a total Scratch newbie: I have never worked with lists before I started working on this project. This code is still a work in progress. I could only get one button (up arrow/hat block) to correctly say the two recordings. The stack button says the first recording correctly when the switch is first pressed, but then says both recordings on the second press. I am stuck on how to fix this. The rest of the buttons say only one recording each - as of right now.. I learned how to make these switches from Scrappy Circuits. On one cardboard rectangle, attach two binder clips and one paper clip to make a push switch. Here is a video showing how to make the switch. You will need to make five switches. Cut out the labels from the shape block sheet you printed. Tape a label to each switch (hat, stack, boolean, reporter, and c block.. Each switch will need two alligator clips. You will connect each switch to earth and the corresponding outputs on the Makey Makey. The binder clip that remains flat connects to earth. The binder clip with the bent up paper clip connects to the arrows or space bar outputs on the Makey Makey.. hat = up arrow. stack = right arrow. boolean = down arrow. reporter = left arrow. c block = space bar. Now, when the push switches are pressed, one switch is a BOSS (hat) because it works. The stack switch is trying its best, but can't keep up with hat yet. And the boolean, reporter, and c block switches don't know know any better. They are content (for now) to be one trick ponies.."
"The Sociable Syllables Activity Pad was created as an Assistive Technology teaching tool for Hard of Hearing students. In my classroom experience and after conversations with Hard of Hearing Consultants, 3 tips came to mind in the creation of the Sociable Syllables Activity Pad to support these students. . 1. Vocabulary: Pre-teach curriculum vocabulary and concepts. In order to have better success, learning keywords ahead of the lesson can be essential for Hard of Hearing students.. 2. Use of Visuals: Visuals provide verification of what was heard and can also provide ongoing reference during class for Hard of Hearing students.. 3. Word Endings: Grammatical features that are impacted by hearing loss, while pronouncing words, can include omitting certain word endings: . a) /s/ - which impacts plurals, possessives and noun-verb agreement . b) -ed - which impacts production of past tense . c) -ing - which impacts production of progressive tense. For this project, my goal is for Hard of Hearing students to practice saying the words, syllable by syllable, while properly pronouncing the word from beginning to end. This Assistive Technology teaching tool could definitely extend beyond Hard of Hearing students as others may benefit from its use dependant on their learning needs and styles.. Teachers!

"Hello Makers! . I'm glad to share with you this wood storage cart made for our educational MakerSpace! It's common to have a lot of wood scraps so it's very important to have an organized workshop for security matters, so I hope you find this project useful. . Note: I see a lot of projects where people use circular saw machines or else, but we don't have a lot of tools so my design is easy-to-assembly. . -----------------. Hola Makers! . Encantada de compartir este carrito organizador de madera para nuestro MakerSpace educativo! Es muy común tener muchos sobrantes de madera y la seguridad es primero por lo que es importante mantener el taller organizado, espero les guste el proyecto. . Nota: Muchos proyectos que encontré usan sierra circular o máquinas complejas que nosotros no tenemos, por lo que me enfoqué en el diseño de un armado simple. . Materiales:. 4 llantas (tamaño a su gusto). 1 bolsa de pijas para madera de #8x1"". Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. I got inspired by ""Tamara's Scrap Wood Storage Cart"" found on youtube but I didn't have enough budget or machines to do it similar, so I recommend to make your own design. I used Fusion360 to model the idea, I only wanted to use 2 plywood boards with the 3D design I was able to analyze how much material will be used or how It will be assembled.. I recommend you to first sketch or model if you can the idea depending on materials or budget you may have. . Or you can download the PDF for the plans! . ----- . Me inspiré en el proyecto de Tamara encontrado en youtube, pero no tenía tanto presupuesto, materiales ni máquinas para hacerlo tal cual, por eso elegí primero modelar en 3D mi diseño para calcular la mejor distribución de piezas, el armado y aprovechamiento de materiales ya que sólo quería utilizar uno o dos paneles de triplay. . Yo recomiendo que primero hagan su diseño ya sea en boceto o 3D dependiendo de su presupuesto o materiales. O pueden descargar el PDF con el plano.. My local wood store offers the wood cutting service, so I asked them for less cuts than what I designed first (You can see the actual cuts in PDF attached file) because I only wanted to use 2 plywood boards and use a piece of it for another wood project. . You can either call this stingy or clever for using less material. (This project was low budget). ------. La maderería local ofrece el servicio de corte de la madera, por lo que modifiqué el diseño para menos cortes y sólo comprar 2 tablones completos además de poder usar el sobrante para otro proyecto. . Pueden descargar el PDF con la imagen de cortes. Llámenlo ser tacaño o astuto por usar menos material pero recuerden que este proyecto es de bajo presupuesto y poco tiempo de armado. . It took me 1hour to build this wood cart (time-lapse video), think first which pieces will be together to make it less complicated, specially if you're by your own. . Assembly tips: If you can always have 2 drills is better: one with the drill a bit thinner than the wooden stem, the second one with the cross tip to screw the stem, this is very practical and effective.. -----------. Me tomó 2 horas armar el carro de madera, piensen primero cuáles son las mejores piezas para armar primero especialmente si lo arman solos. . Truco de ensamble: Si pueden tener siempre 2 taladros: 1 con la broca más delgada que la pija para guiar, el segundo con la punta de cruz para atornillar las pijas es muy práctico y efectivo. ."
"Teachers teach ALL students. Sometimes our learning needs to look different depending on the student. Below is an example of an easy lesson you can create to make sure all of your students are working on essential skills.. This project would work well for Adapted Learning students as well as Visually Impaired students.. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Using the shape PDF I cut out shapes and wrapped them in HVAC tape. You can also use tin foil. You can use however many shapes you want for this project. I chose to use all 9 shapes on the PDF.. For this step you will want to apply a conducting piece of HVAC tape or tin foil to the board where your shape will connect to. I just cut out circles for this step. Next, I made a pressure switch out of each shape. I cut out pieces of foam to raise the shape above the conducting circle that is attached to the board. I used a hot glue gun to make sure all the pieces would stay connected.. Now I cut a hole in the board where each wire can poke up next to the shape. I ran alligator clips to all shapes and connected them. I also ran copper tape from each shape to the bottom of the board to make the ground connection. On the back side of the board I taped down the wires and labeled what action went to what clip.. Once my board was set up, I created a simple code that allowed each command to say a different shape. Since I had 9 shapes, I needed 9 keyboard commands.. Here is the link to the scratch program.. The last step was to connect all the alligator clips to the Makey Makey and the board. I also created a QR code so that students can scan the code and head straight to the Scratch Program. . I used an iPad to play the Shape Board, but a computer will also work.. Further Ideas:. After creating this activity, I plan to make a color board and an alphabet board so that kids can practice spelling their names!. This is an entry in the First Time Author Contest."
"For this project, students will make a scene from a novel or a story and then use the Makey Makey and Scratch to tell what is going on in the scene. This is a great way to help students visualize while integrating coding in! . -A novel or a book with a scene to create. -Play-doh. -A Makey Makey. -Computer that can access Scratch. -Paper and pencil . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Have students read a book or a chapter from a novel and draw a sketch of what they are visualizing. In addition, have then write why they included each part in the sketch. Next, give students Play-doh and ask them to recreate the scene. Also ask them to write a 3-5 sentence summary about what they created. They should be prepared to say something about each component of the scene they created. . Students will go to scratch.mit.edu and hit start creating. . Students will do a recording for each part that they included in their scene.. Start with adding a ""when space key pressed"" code block which can be found under events. . Then go to sound and add a ""play sound until done"" code block. . Click on the pink ""Play Sound Meow until done"" code block and from the drop down menu select ""record"". . Pick one component of the Play-doh scene to talk about.. Students will hit record button and talk about one of the what they sculpted. For example, they might say something like ""In this chapter, the main setting was a river so that is why I sculpted a river. During the chapter, Serafina hid in the bushes near the river."" . After the recording is finished hit save. . You can also change the name of the recording to river for example if you want. After the recording is finished, go back to the code and select the name that you have given it. . Drag over another event ""When space key pressed"" block and add a play sound code. From the drop down menu, hit record and record yourself talking about another part of the scene that you made out of Play-doh. My scene has three parts so I did three separate recordings. . During this step you want to plug the Makey Makey into your computer. . For each event of your code, make sure you have different keys. . For example, my code used the space bar, the up arrow, and the down arrow. . Here is a link with the code: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/389932699/editor. Attach one of the alligator clips in the space slot and then attach the other end of the clip to the Play-doh creation that fits with that key. . Attach the rest of the alligator clips to the corresponding Play-doh creations and then plug them into the correct Makey Makey slots that fit with your code. See the video for more specific guidance. . In order for the Makey Makey to work, it needs a complete circuit. Make a ball of Play-doh and stick an alligator clip inside of it and attach the other end of the alligator clip to Earth. . Make sure that the different Play-doh parts do not touch. . Then put one finger on the Earth ball of Play-doh and another one on a part of the scene. . When a part is touched, then the recording in Scratch will play. . See the video for a demo of how it works! ."
"This guide will share with you how to create a hands-free voting booth using the Makey Makey and Scratch. This project allows voters to step on a pad on the floor to cast their vote for their favorite book character. It is based on two Makey Makey projects: Ultimate Stomping Pad with Makey Makey and Make Your Own Exit Ticket or Data Tracker. By completing this project you will learn how to create a pressure sensor for the Makey Makey and create a script in Scratch to tally votes.. The inspiration for this project came from the desire to provide some type of self directed program for children during a library summer reading program. The stomp pad element will allow users to participate in a hands-free manner and to prevent the spread of disease via high contact items.. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. This project will require the creation of a stomp pad for each voting selection. Makey Makey has created an excellent Instructable to show you how to create a stomp pad.. The stomp pad is a pressure switch for the Makey Makey that is constructed with cardboard, aluminum foil, copper tape, wire, duct tape, and rubber bands. When the stomp pad is pressed it will complete an electric circuit when paired with the Makey Makey. The Makey Makey, in turn, will control your Scratch program. With each press on the stomp pad a vote will be logged in the Scratch program.. To create your stomp pad you will need to cut two cardboard pieces into matching rectangles. Pictured stomp pads are roughly 4x3 inches. You will then need to cover each of these cardboard pieces with aluminum foil. Be sure to leave some extra foil at the end to fold over your cardboard edge. Glue aluminum foil to cardboard. (Picture 2). Next, you will secure two of the white connecting wires found in your Makey Makey kit to your stomp pad. Lay your cardboard pieces side by side as if they were a book laying open. Using clear tape, secure your wires to your cardboard squares near the center of the aluminum foil to maximize the connection in the circuit. (Picture 3). Now, you will reinforce the electric connections with your wires. Cut several small pieces of your copper tape. Use the copper tape to connect the exposed part of the wire to your aluminum foil. Cover this connection and the edge of your cardboard with duct tape. (Pictures 3 & 4). It is time to connect your cardboard pieces together. Line your cardboard up side by side and place duct tape over the seam. (Picture 5). Close your cardboard ""book"" and then cover the outside seam (or spine) with duct tape as well. (Picture 6).. To ensure that your circuit is not completed until someone presses on it you will now add an insulator. Add 5 rubber bands to your stomp pad as pictured (Picture 7).. You have now created a stomp pad! You will need one stomp pad per voting selection. In this example, we are allowing students to choose from four different book characters. (Picture 1).. It is time to connect your stomp pad to your Makey Makey. There are two wires coming from your stomp pad. One wire will be connected to your Earth and the other will be connected to a key press (such as an arrow). . Let's code!. Now we're going to code our voting booth using Scratch. Scratch is a free, block based coding program available from MIT. We're going to code a program to keep score of votes and use the Makey Makey as the controller for this program. The Scratch program that we will create will include the creation of variables and a score keeping mechanism. To create this program you will need to have the following Scratch skills: how to change and add sprites, and how to change your background.. To begin, you will change our background to something fun. We chose a space theme. We have also added text to our background via the background costume. You will then add the sprites that you would like voters to choose from when they vote. We have added 4 sprites. (Picture 1). You will now need to create a variable to represent each of your voting options. From the block choices select variable (these are orange blocks). Your options for variable blocks will now appear. Select ""make variable."" (Picture 2). Now name your variable (Picture 3). Create a variable for each voting selection. Our example has a variable for caterpillar, elephant, cat, and dog. (Picture 4).. A variable is a new item of your own creation in your code!. You will now create a code for each one of your sprites using these variables. (Pictures 5-8). Each sprite will contain three coding sections. The first section will set your variables score to 0. The second section will tell your variable's score to change by 1 when the appropriate key is pressed. This part will be controlled by your Makey Makey. The third coding section will show the final score for each variable.. Section 1: Set your score to 0. Section 2: Change score by 1. Section 3: Final Score. Pictures 5-8 outline the code for each sprite. We have used the same code for all the sprites with a few alterations. The variable used for each sprite should be the one that represents it. For the elephant sprite we used the elephant variable. Each sprite's counter will respond to an individual key press. For our example we used the arrow keys and each sprite responds to one arrow (up, down, left, or right). . It's time to put it all together! In order to create the hands-free voting station you will now connect your stomp pads to your Scratch program using the Makey Makey. . Your Makey Makey will be used to control the keys that you have selected in your Scratch program. In our example we are using the arrows (up, down, left, right). Each sprite in your Scratch program has a point counter that will respond to one of these arrows. You will now need to connect your stomp pads to each one of these keys on your Makey Makey.(Pictures 1).. Your stomp pads have two wires coming out of them: one that is Earth and one that will connect to your key. Using your alligator clips connect these two wires to the Makey Makey. Clip the alligator clips to the wires on your stomp pad. (Picture 2). Clip the other end of the Earth cable to the Earth bar. Then clip the other end of your other cable to one of the arrows (or your selected key). (Picture 3). Repeat for all stomp pads and remaining keys. Make sure to mark your stomp pads in some way to make sure they connect to the matching key press. We glued a picture of the character we wanted represented on each stomp pad (Picture 4).. Once you have connected all of your stomp pads to your Makey Makey you can plug your Makey Makey into your computer with the USB cable. This will power it on. If you step on your stomp pads you should see that the light on the Makey Makey comes on for each key press. It's working! Once you press the space bar your final vote count will appear. Who won the vote?. Place this project on a table and allow your students to vote for their favorite book character. Then reveal the winner!."

"What is a barge? . A barge is a type of flat-bottomed boat that is used to transport goods on rivers and canals. First barges were towed by horses who led the boat down rivers by pulling them. Now they are self-propelled and run on their own engines making it so they can carry much more weight in less time. . How much can one barge hold? . An average American barge can hold 1,500 tons or 3,000,000 pounds of weight. That is like having over 230 full grown elephants on one barge! . In this instructable you will be making a small cork barge and seeing how strong and how much weight your creation can hold. . Why do corks float?. Floating or sinking of an object does not depend on its weight, it depends upon its density. Things denser than water sink in water whereas things having less mass than water float on it.. Cork – Several corks long round ones work best. Those with the mushroom head could be used, but you will need to flip them opposite each other to create a strong structure.. Hot glue gun – Any type will work just fun be sure to have parental supervision. You cannot use any water soluble glue like Elmer's glue because it will melt away when put in water.. Testing supplies:. Large bowl or sink – A large bowl is a great option so you do not need to fill it will as much water. . Water – Enough to fill your bowl or sink well enough to place your barge in without touching the bottom or the edges. . Weights – You will want to pick small items that can easily stack, things that have different heaviness, and items that are water resistant.. *Optional . Small scale – A kitchen scale or small mailing scale. This is used if you want to know exactly how much weight your barge can hold.. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Start by seeing how many used corks you have around the house. Be sure to ask your adult if there are any you can use, and don't remove any from bottles yourself.. Lay them out trying to make a large flat surface. You will need to move them around and see how large you want to go on your first try. There are no wrong ideas here so be sure to have fun.. With your glue gun, glue together all the corks keeping it flat on the table while you do it. This will help keep them as level as possible so you have a good base to stack your items on top.. Leave plenty of time for the hot glue to cool before you try moving it. Patience is key for this step!. For those using mushroom top corks you will want to lay them opposite tops to bottoms so that they make a straight line not a semi-circle.. In this last step you will want an area that is okay if you get water around your station. Great places to do this are your back or front porch, in your shower or tub, in the kitchen or bathroom sink, etc. . Have all of your plastic waterproof toys ready to slowly add to your barge one by one.. Think of it as reverse Jenga and try to get as many items on as you can. Weight will play a big part on how long your barge can stay afloat, but balancing the items from middle outwards will allow you to get the most on at at time.. At some point your barge will sink with the weight of your items though. When that happens stop adding new items and then remove those that sunk. Count how many you were able to get on and keep trying several times placing them on different spots and in different orders. . For those who want to know exactly how much weight their barge can hold use a kitchen or small postal scale to weigh all of the toys that sunk into the water.. Once you’ve gotten the hang of creating your barge try making it even larger in your next model.Does adding sides help or make it sink faster? Does making a perfectly flat surface on top of the cork help or make it heavier? . See what the limits of your cork are and your ability to balance the items. . Keep a running tally with those in your household to see who can get the most on. The person who gets the most weight on the barge before it sinks wins!.

"This easy project is great for anyone looking for a safe way to prop up your phone.. In the world of remote teaching, educators are having to record video lessons using our phones. This 3D project will teach you how to design and print a cell phone holder to help you record those lessons without having to ask a family member to hold your phone, or to precariously balance your phone while you teach to your students.. . Tinkercad - for making your own design. Or you can duplicate and edit mine.. Ruler. 3D printer and filament . Phone. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Before we open Tinkercad you need to measure your phone and decide what kinds of angles you need your phone to be positioned in.. For my phone holder I wanted a variety of different angles to capture the variety of lesson I'd be filming. You want at least a 45 degree angle for filming down at a surface and a 90 degree angle so you can do a straight on view. . Here is a good right triangle calculator so you can figure out side lengths for a desired angle: https://www.calculator.net/right-triangle-calcula.... Before you move on - measure the width of your phone. It is important to know how wide you need to separate the wedges in Tinkercad. If the spacing is wrong, you either will not be able to fit your phone into the holder, or your phone will slouch and you will not get the angle you were looking for.. My phone with its protective case was 12mm. We don't want that cellphone toppling over in the middle of filming. Starting with a sold base is important. . I'm sure there is some mathematical way to calculate the area and weight of filament to counterbalance the weight of the phone...I used guess and check, and lucked out. You want a large heavy base to counterbalance your phone. If your base is too light, it will tip over and your phone will come crashing down. . My base is 100mm by 100mm with a height of 5mm. To save you all some time, I made a youtube tutorial to watch. This is far superior to reading my written directions.. To make a 45 degree wedge:. Using the Basic Shapes menu -> select the Wedge. Adjust the length to 30mm and the height to 30 mm. To save filament I cut my wedge into multiple triangles rather than one large wedge. If you want the segment it, adjust the width to 5mm. Then raise the wedge up 5mm so it sits on top of the base flush with the corner. Move the wedge in 10mm from the edge. Duplicate the wedge and move the copy 20mm (so there is a 15mm gap). Repeat until you have 5 equal wedges.. Thats it! . Just repeat this process with the rest of the angles you want. If you are having trouble, I recommend watching the youtube tutorial.. After you are done building it in Tinkercad, export it and print it.. For my prints, I use my school's XYZ DaVinci 1.0 AIO with PLA filament. Best of luck! .

"I am a K-5 STEAM Lab teacher who sees 3-6 classes each day. When students come to my lab I like to meet them at the door and welcome them to class and then again at the end of class say goodbye to each student. That personal greeting is part of building relationships with each student and that is very important to me. My problem is that the short transition time between classes means I am often cleaning up and prepping for my next class as the students leave. I created the Goobye Bell so each person gets a personal message from me as they leave class.. 8"" X 10"" cardstock (your color choice). Pencil. Markers. Aluminum foil. Copper tape (optional). 2""-3"" circle tracer. Glue stick. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Draw or trace a large hand on the 8"" X 10"" cardstock. . Color the hand in as you like with markers. Trace a 2'-3' circle on the aluminum foil. The size will depend on the the size of the hand you drew in step one. You want the foil circle to easily fit inside the hand. Cut out the foil circle.. Cut the foil circle in half and trim a small strip (approx. 1/8""-1/4"") from the straight side of each half circle. Glue the two half circles to the middle of the hand on the cardstock. The circles should be 1/4""-1/2"" apart depending on the size of the hand (mine are 3/8"" apart) The two pieces must not touch.. NOTE - If you do not have copper tape use 1/4""-1/2"" strips of foil). Cut the tape or foil strip long enough to reach from the middle of the left half of the foil circle to the bottom of the page and fold over the back of the cardstock about 1"". Repeat with another strip of copper tape or foil from the center of the right half of the foil circle to the bottom of the cardstock and 1"" up the back.. ** If using copper tape that is not conductive on both sides fold over about 1"" of the tape and stick it to itself before attaching to foil circle and cardstock. You want to be sure the conductive side of the tape is touching the foil circle.. Record 4-8 separate audio goodbye greetings in Scratch (scratch.mit.edu) Give each recording a distinct name so you can identify it when writing the code.. Create your code. Here is my code to get you started. Goodbye Bell. I used 8 different greetings to give more variety. When I tested with only 4 greetings I found the program repeated the same greeting multiple times. More greetings limited that happening. The program could also be written with only one greeting.. Connect one alligator clip from the Space port on the Makey Makey board to one of the copper (or foil) strips at the bottom of the cardstock. Connect the other alligator clip from the earth bar to the other copper (or foil) strip at the bottom of the cardstock. Connect the Makey Makey to the computer. . .

"I am an ART teacher /teaching from home. I spend my days creating activities for my students and delivering them on line so they can create at home. I like to offer projects with materials that they hopefully have on hand, unlike when we are in my ART room at school. This is a fun and easy printmaking activity that can be done from home because you do not need a press. . Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. The supplies are very basic as long as you have a cupcake tin in the kitchen!. Paint *I am using my grandsons paint set. (www.kidsmademodern.com) they are brightly colored, water based paints, similar to poster paint or tempera. any paint you have will work including acrylic or even oil paint. . brush. cup for water,. thin sharpie. Paper. Begin by painting the underside of the clean muffin tin. Use a lot of different colors.. When all the surfaces have been painted carefully lay the paper on top of the tin and gently rub each area. . when it is lifted, the paint will be offset onto the paper. . You can do a second print, or ghost print with the remaining colors. . I used my ghost print to make my Colorful Dot-to-Dots drawing.. Using a sharpie (or any drawing tool you are comfortable with) create decorative lines to connect your dots. . On another print I made X marks on each surface before I printed it. When I made my connecting lines I arranged them into more of an X pattern.. You can also use the other end of the paintbrush to make marks in the paint before you print it. . Have fun.

"Giving the circumstances that the world is going through right now, I wanted to join the people on the 3D printing community that are helping with their projects. . This project isn't much but I thought of sharing it anyway. joining the #stayhome trend to show the importance of self quarantine to help decrease and slow down the spread of the coronavirus.. this is a desk-top item that shows the words ""Stay"", ""Home"" respectively depending on the angle it is seen from.. I designed this model using Fusion 360 and below are the steps to create your own or use this method to create other text or anamorphic art.. It can be 3D printed on any settings with some support.. Post processing is optional.. 3D printer (can use online printing servies). Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. In Fusion 360, I used the ""Text"" tool from ""Sketch"" menu and wrote the word ""STAY"" using a bold font. Then I extruded the text using the extrude tool to a generous length the longer the better, because the access wont matter at the next step). Then on the other axis of the design I wrote the word ""HOME"" using the same bold font.. Then again, using the extrude tool I pulled the word ""HOME"" to intersect with the previously extruded word ""STAY"" and chose the option ""Intersect"" from the Operation menu.. So I was left with the shape in the picture above, all the parts at which the letters of the two words intersect each other.. Now in the ""bodies"" selection menu on the left side, we find that many bodies have been created.. I went ahead and highlighted the bodies I want to keep in the image above.. Then I selected all the bodies except these that I want to keep, and hit ""V"" on the keyboard or just simple toggle the light bulb icon next to each body to hide it until I was left with the second image. . Finally I drew a simple rectangle using the sketch tool and extruded it downwards so it becomes a base for the letters to sit on.. You can use any shape of base you like.. Finally I gave the edges of the base a ""Fillet"" to round them off.. If you haven't tried modeling it yourself, go ahead and download the model attached! and print it using your preferred settings.. Using support is advised.. You can use different color for the base by pausing the printer, changing the color, and hitting continue to print the letters with a different color or material..
